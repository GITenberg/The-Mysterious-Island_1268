      &ldquo;Are we rising again?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. On the contrary.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are we descending?&rdquo; &ldquo;Worse
      than that, captain! we are falling!&rdquo; &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake heave out the
      ballast!&rdquo; &ldquo;There! the last sack is empty!&rdquo; &ldquo;Does the balloon rise?&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I hear a noise like the dashing of waves. The sea is below the car! It

      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air,
      above the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening of the 23rd of March, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast, in
      the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without
      intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were terrible
      in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen hundred
      miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the thirty-fifth north
      parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were overthrown, forests
      uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of water which were
      precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published
      accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts
      which destroyed everything they passed over, several thousand people
      crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces of its fury, left
      by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters those which so
      frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th of October,
      1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a
      drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a
      waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of air
      and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning round
      and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five
      passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with
      spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From what
      part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started during the
      storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the first symptoms
      were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that the balloon came
      from a great distance, for it could not have traveled less than two
      thousand miles in twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,
      could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since
      their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the very midst
      of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They were thrown
      about and whirled round and round without feeling the rotation in the
      slightest degree, or being sensible that they were removed from a
      horizontal position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered
      beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density of
      the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or night.
      No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring of the
      ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while suspended in
      those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had informed them of the
      dangers which they ran from the waves. However, the balloon, lightened of
      heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen into
      the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet. The
      voyagers, after having discovered that the sea extended beneath them, and
      thinking the dangers above less dreadful than those below, did not
      hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful articles, while they
      endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life of their enterprise,
      which sustained them above the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to
      less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began
      to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March, it showed
      symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had risen into
      the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind had changed
      from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate of the
      transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It was still
      what sailors call &ldquo;a close-reefed topsail breeze,&rdquo; but the commotion in
      the elements had none the less considerably diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards eleven o&rsquo;clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer.
      The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the
      passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone farther to
      the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have passed away
      in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons
      of the Indian Ocean?
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again
      slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,
      little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and
      extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the
      balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It
      contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it could
      maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a great
      altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles which
      still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept, everything,
      even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted himself on to
      the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to secure more firmly
      the lower point of the balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and
      that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions. They
      must infallibly perish!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them. The
      watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid surface
      upon which their anchor could hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous
      violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those
      whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of
      forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,
      appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and
      disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not a
      solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest their
      downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in the
      waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work. But,
      notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the same
      time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of the
      wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were
      evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were
      useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas escaped
      without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was visibly
      accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet of the
      ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a
      large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which it
      contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension in the
      air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only be
      retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and
      balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly
      dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single murmur
      escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the last
      minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a sort of
      willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest
      possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was
      inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not less
      determined. &ldquo;Is everything thrown out?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, here are still 2,000 dollars
      in gold.&rdquo; A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. &ldquo;Does the balloon
      rise?&rdquo; &ldquo;A little, but it will not be long before it falls again.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
      still remains to be thrown out?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes! the car!&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us catch
      hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon. The
      ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,
      mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the net,
      and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to
      throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical
      position. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical
      precision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of
      any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So it
      happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant aloft,
      the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent which it was
      impossible to repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held
      pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top has seen something,&rdquo; cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud
      voice shouted,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land! land!&rdquo; The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the
      southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might be
      reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in fact,
      appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles off. It
      would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there was the
      chance of falling to leeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it
      yet retained?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that
      solid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what
      it was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what
      part of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach this
      land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several
      times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of
      the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose, like a
      bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not more than a
      mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in great folds, had
      gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to the net, were still
      too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the sea, they were beaten by
      the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out again, and the wind, taking
      it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it not possibly thus reach the
      land?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs
      of lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never
      again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck by
      a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new part
      of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it met a
      current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast, carried
      it in a nearly parallel direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on a
      sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from the
      meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken by the
      wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant, disappeared
      into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon
      only left four on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had just
      struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened
      balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the land. Scarcely
      had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they all, thinking of
      the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, &ldquo;Perhaps he will try to swim to
      land! Let us save him! let us save him!&rdquo;

      Chapter 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither
      aeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose
      boldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they almost
      fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But Heaven
      had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the 20th of
      March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General Ulysses
      Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the capital of
      Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South, during the
      terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted five days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups de
      main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess himself
      of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the enemy and
      were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was Captain Cyrus
      Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class engineer, to whom
      the government had confided, during the war, the direction of the
      railways, which were so important at that time. A true Northerner, thin,
      bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his close-cut hair and his
      beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache, were already getting gray.
      He had one-of those finely-developed heads which appear made to be struck
      on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious mouth, the physiognomy of a clever
      man of the military school. He was one of those engineers who began by
      handling the hammer and pickaxe, like generals who first act as common
      soldiers. Besides mental power, he also possessed great manual dexterity.
      His muscles exhibited remarkable proofs of tenacity. A man of action as
      well as a man of thought, all he did was without effort to one of his
      vigorous and sanguine temperament. Learned, clear-headed, and practical,
      he fulfilled in all emergencies those three conditions which united ought
      to insure human success&mdash;activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes,
      and powerful will. He might have taken for his motto that of William of
      Orange in the 17th century: &ldquo;I can undertake and persevere even without
      hope of success.&rdquo; Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in
      all the battles of that war. After having begun as a volunteer at
      Illinois, under Ulysses Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg
      Landing, at the siege of Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga,
      the Wilderness, on the Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy
      of the general who said, &ldquo;I never count my dead!&rdquo; And hundreds of times
      Captain Harding had almost been among those who were not counted by the
      terrible Grant; but in these combats where he never spared himself,
      fortune favored him till the moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner
      on the field of battle near Richmond. At the same time and on the same day
      another important personage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This
      was no other than Gideon Spilett, a reporter for the New York Herald, who
      had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the
      Northern armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American
      chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain exact
      information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest possible
      time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald, are
      genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with. Gideon
      Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great merit,
      energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having traveled
      over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council,
      resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when
      in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a
      perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects, of the
      unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He was one of those
      intrepid observers who write under fire, &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; among bullets, and to
      whom every danger is welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one
      hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble. He
      did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who speak
      when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short, decisive, and
      clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he was not wanting in
      humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black River, determined at
      any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the telegraph office, and
      after having announced to his journal the result of the battle,
      telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the Bible. It cost the New
      York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New York Herald published the
      first intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age. Light
      whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady, lively,
      rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take in at a
      glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to all
      climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York Herald,
      which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as skilful in
      the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured, he was in the
      act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The last words in
      his note-book were these: &ldquo;A Southern rifleman has just taken aim at me,
      but&mdash;&rdquo; The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon Spilett, who,
      with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except by
      reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer&rsquo;s wounds
      rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made
      acquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate
      each other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping,
      rejoining Grant&rsquo;s army, and fighting together in the ranks of the
      Federals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance; but
      although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town, Richmond was
      so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In the meanwhile
      Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted to him in life
      and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on the engineer&rsquo;s
      estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus, who was an
      Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given his freedom.
      The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He would have
      died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active, clever,
      intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry, obliging,
      and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered to the
      familiar abbreviation of Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left
      Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond, and
      by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life twenty
      times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The pleasure of
      Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding his master,
      can scarcely be described.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite
      another thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very
      strictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the
      attempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did not
      present itself, but was very difficult to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of
      Petersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of
      Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave the
      prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single
      incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active mind
      was occupied with one sole thought&mdash;how he might get out of Richmond
      at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt, but was stopped
      by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege continued; and if the
      prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant&rsquo;s army, certain of the
      besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern forces. Among them was
      one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner. The truth was, that if the
      prisoners of the Secessionists could not leave the town, neither could the
      Secessionists themselves while the Northern army invested it. The Governor
      of Richmond for a long time had been unable to communicate with General
      Lee, and he very much wished to make known to him the situation of the
      town, so as to hasten the march of the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan
      Forster accordingly conceived the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to
      pass over the besieging lines, and in that way reach the Secessionist
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and placed
      at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five other
      persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have to defend
      themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of their aerial
      voyage being prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should be
      effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force, and
      the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee&rsquo;s camp in a few
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was
      evident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became such
      that Forster&rsquo;s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to risk the
      balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to depart
      on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the
      impatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the weather.
      There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened to the
      ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with
      redoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the
      streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This
      was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years of
      age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of bright
      sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an American
      from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had gone
      through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being with
      two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that he was a
      bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished at
      nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond on
      business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a former
      captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his own child. Not
      having been able to leave the town before the first operations of the
      siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust; but, not accustomed
      to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by some means or other.
      He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew with what impatience
      that determined man chafed under his restraint. On this day he did not,
      therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without circumlocution, &ldquo;Have
      you had enough of Richmond, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a low
      voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding, will you try to escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this question
      was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined the
      stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating eye
      observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had before
      him an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft made himself known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;and in what way do you propose to escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks
      to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The engineer
      understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and dragged him to
      his house. There the sailor developed his project, which was indeed
      extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its execution.
      The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so clever and
      daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how to manage a
      balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art of sailing in
      the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft would not have
      hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend Herbert with him;
      for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the ocean, he was not to
      be hindered on account of the hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word, but his
      eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for opportunity&mdash;he
      was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible, though, it must be
      confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night, in spite of their
      guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the car, and then cut
      the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they might be killed, but
      on the other hand they might succeed, and without this storm!&mdash;Without
      this storm the balloon would have started already and the looked-for
      opportunity would not have then presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not alone!&rdquo; said Harding at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many people do you wish to bring with you?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be three,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;and with Herbert and me five. But
      the balloon will hold six&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be enough, we will go,&rdquo; answered Harding in a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;we&rdquo; included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew, was
      not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him he
      approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple an
      idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his master
      wherever his master wished to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening, then,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;we will all meet out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening, at ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied Captain Harding; &ldquo;and Heaven grant
      that the storm does not abate before our departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging, where
      young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the sailor&rsquo;s
      plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result of the
      proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined persons were
      about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous elements!
    </p>
    <p>
      No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his
      companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it was
      that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the wind, would
      be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the nearly-deserted
      square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same on his side, his
      hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man who did not know how
      to kill the time, but really dreading, like his friend, either the escape
      or destruction of the balloon. Evening arrived. The night was dark in the
      extreme. Thick mists passed like clouds close to the ground. Rain fell
      mingled with snow, it was very cold. A mist hung over Richmond. It seemed
      as if the violent storm had produced a truce between the besiegers and the
      besieged, and that the cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of
      the storm. The streets of the town were deserted. It had not even appeared
      necessary in that horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the
      midst of which plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of
      the prisoners, but what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous
      voyage they contemplated in the midst of the furious elements?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty weather!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head
      with a blow of his fist; &ldquo;but pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different
      directions into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the wind,
      had left in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost beaten to
      the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of ballast, to
      which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was held by a strong
      cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five prisoners met by the
      car. They had not been perceived, and such was the darkness that they
      could not even see each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their
      places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer&rsquo;s order detached
      successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only,
      and the sailor rejoined his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had nothing
      to do but to give the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top, a
      favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his chain,
      had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional weight
      might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more will make but little difference, poor beast!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the
      cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after
      having dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it
      swept by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the
      voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending, and
      when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the wide
      extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest fury by
      the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals who
      set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of March.
      Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast, seven
      thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was missing,
      the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the engineer,
      Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet, they all
      hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.

      Chapter 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried off
      by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal had
      voluntarily leaped out to help his master. &ldquo;Forward,&rdquo; cried the reporter;
      and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting their
      fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving way to
      despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared
      to the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes
      therefore of arriving in time to save him. &ldquo;Let us look for him! let us
      look for him!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Neb,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and we will find him too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living, I trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he swim?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;and besides, Top is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half a
      mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point of
      the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then nearly six o&rsquo;clock. A thick fog made the night very dark. The
      castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had
      thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they
      could not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with
      stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground,
      very unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes,
      making walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute
      great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more
      active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor
      thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose above
      the roaring of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for
      some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had
      landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the
      barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to
      give any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose
      above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little
      band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of
      the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly brought
      to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to their feet. The
      solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the extremity of a sharp
      point on which the sea broke furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a promontory,&rdquo; said the sailor; &ldquo;we must retrace our steps, holding
      towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he is there,&rdquo; said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone
      of a snowy white in the darkness. &ldquo;Well, let us call again,&rdquo; and all
      uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no reply.
      They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the
      promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft
      observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he
      declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive front
      he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the mist. The
      birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea was also less
      tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the waves was
      diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This side of the
      promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the sharp point
      sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow this direction
      was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the coast where Harding
      might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a half, the shore presented
      no curve which would permit them to return to the north. This promontory,
      of which they had turned the point, must be attached to the mainland. The
      castaways, although their strength was nearly exhausted, still marched
      courageously forward, hoping every moment to meet with a sudden angle
      which would set them in the first direction. What was their
      disappointment, when, after trudging nearly two miles, having reached an
      elevated point composed of slippery rocks, they found themselves again
      stopped by the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on an islet,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;and we have surveyed it from one
      extremity to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not even
      on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in length,
      with even a less breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with stones
      and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important archipelago? It
      was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car saw the land
      through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter it sufficiently.
      However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes to piece through the
      gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly distinguish in the west
      confused masses which indicated an elevated coast. But they could not in
      the dark determine whether it was a single island, or connected with
      others. They could not leave it either, as the sea surrounded them; they
      must therefore put off till the next day their search for the engineer,
      from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached them to show that he was
      still in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The silence of our friend proves nothing,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;Perhaps he
      has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will not
      despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet, which
      would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain for
      wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found. The
      grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to the
      intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too
      evident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what
      patience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to
      save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast,
      or he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold
      was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived
      it. They did not even think of taking a minute&rsquo;s rest. Forgetting
      everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued
      to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its northern
      point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the catastrophe.
      They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices, they endeavored
      to raise even a louder shout than before, which would be transmitted to a
      great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to a calm, and the noise of
      the sea began also to subside. One of Neb&rsquo;s shouts even appeared to
      produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft&rsquo;s attention to it, adding,
      &ldquo;That proves that there is a coast to the west, at no great distance.&rdquo; The
      sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not deceive him. If he had
      discovered land, however indistinct it might appear, land was sure to be
      there. But that distant echo was the only response produced by Neb&rsquo;s
      shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the part east of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the
      stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions he
      would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern
      Hemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not
      those which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the
      Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed away. Towards five o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the 25th of
      March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark, but with
      daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could scarcely
      penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At length the
      fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish nothing
      around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast upon the
      ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast in the west.
      But not a speck of land was visible. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;though
      I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there... there... as sure as the
      fact that we are no longer at Richmond.&rdquo; But the fog was not long in
      rising. It was only a fine-weather mist. A hot sun soon penetrated to the
      surface of the island. About half-past six, three-quarters of an hour
      after sunrise, the mist became more transparent. It grew thicker above,
      but cleared away below. Soon the isle appeared as if it had descended from
      a cloud, then the sea showed itself around them, spreading far away
      towards the east, but bounded on the west by an abrupt and precipitous
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally insured.
      The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half a mile in
      breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart,
      immediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his
      companions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste to
      be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been
      impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter
      prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. &ldquo;Do you want to cross
      the channel?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Spilett. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said the
      seaman; &ldquo;wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we
      venture into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by the
      current, which is running very strong; but, if I&rsquo;m not wrong, it is
      ebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,
      and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are
      right,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;we will not separate more than we can
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He was
      crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen
      emerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also
      made way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from
      the islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet from
      the place which was opposite to the point from which he had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself
      vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind a rocky
      point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern extremity of
      the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb&rsquo;s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety, and
      when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land where
      their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which the sand
      was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better than
      nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the south
      by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation, and was of a
      very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a grotesque outline
      of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the contrary, the bay
      widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending from the southwest to
      the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape. The distance between
      these two extremities, which made the bow of the bay, was about eight
      miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet, which somewhat resembled
      the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme breadth was not more than a
      quarter of a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with black
      stones, which were now appearing little by little above the retreating
      tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff,
      terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet.
      It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending suddenly on the
      right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the hand of man. On the
      left, above the promontory, this irregular and jagged cliff descended by a
      long slope of conglomerated rocks till it mingled with the ground of the
      southern point. On the upper plateau of the coast not a tree appeared. It
      was a flat tableland like that above Cape Town at the Cape of Good Hope,
      but of reduced proportions; at least so it appeared seen from the islet.
      However, verdure was not wanting to the right beyond the precipice. They
      could easily distinguish a confused mass of great trees, which extended
      beyond the limits of their view. This verdure relieved the eye, so long
      wearied by the continued ranges of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the
      plateau, in a northwesterly direction and at a distance of at least seven
      miles, glittered a white summit which reflected the sun&rsquo;s rays. It was
      that of a lofty mountain, capped with snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed an
      island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding the
      convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have hesitated
      to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably the work of
      subterranean convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on
      which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed
      they might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as
      was likely to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Herbert, &ldquo;what do you say, Pencroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some good and some bad, as in everything,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
      &ldquo;We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we will
      attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get out of
      this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.&rdquo; Pencroft was not wrong in
      his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater part of the
      sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between the islet and
      the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would no doubt be
      easy to cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves
      of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and then
      ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep. Herbert,
      for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through capitally. All
      three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore. Quickly drying
      themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which they had preserved
      from contact with the water, and sat down to take counsel together what to
      do next.

      Chapter 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would
      rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction
      which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened his
      steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon disappeared
      round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop here, my boy,&rdquo; said the sailor; &ldquo;we have to prepare an encampment,
      and to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our friends
      will want something when they come back. There is work for everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the sailor; &ldquo;that will do. We must set about it
      regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have shelter,
      fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests; we have
      only to find a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Herbert, &ldquo;I will look for a cave among the rocks,
      and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Pencroft; &ldquo;go on, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far from
      which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the north,
      they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet from the
      place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which he thought a
      river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was important to
      settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream of water, and on
      the other it was possible that the current had thrown Cyrus Harding on the
      shore there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but
      the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed by
      the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as a
      dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even the
      waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea-fowl,
      and especially those of the web-footed species with long, flat, pointed
      beaks&mdash;a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man, who probably
      for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft recognized the
      skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little sea-mew, which in
      great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite. A shot fired among
      this swarm would have killed a great number, but to fire a shot a gun was
      needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one; besides this, gulls and
      sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their eggs have a detestable
      taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward a little more to the left,
      soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed, which, some hours later, would
      be hidden by the high tide. On these rocks, in the midst of slippery
      wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not to be despised by starving people.
      Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are mussels!&rdquo; cried the sailor; &ldquo;these will do instead of eggs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not mussels,&rdquo; replied Herbert, who was attentively examining the
      molluscs attached to the rocks; &ldquo;they are lithodomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they good to eat?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us eat some lithodomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural
      history, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father
      had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best
      professors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious
      lad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course of
      time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These
      lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering very
      tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous
      perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is
      rounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common
      mussel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were then
      half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had a strong
      peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which
      increased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to
      find fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such a
      capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken the
      precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which they
      filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as
      Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to
      be ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by
      some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a little
      creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle. The
      watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and its two
      banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river became strong
      almost directly between the two walls of granite, which began to sink
      above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a wood of
      stunted trees half a mile off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
      &ldquo;Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this
      time&mdash;that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not
      reach it&mdash;it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert
      looked for some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain;
      everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high
      tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of
      enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and which
      bear the name of &ldquo;Chimneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy
      passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the
      openings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only
      sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also air&mdash;a
      regular corridor-gale&mdash;and with the wind the sharp cold from the
      exterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of the
      openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be rendered
      habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical sign &ldquo;&amp;,&rdquo;
       which signifies &ldquo;et cetera&rdquo; abridged, but by isolating the upper mouth of
      the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so strongly, they
      could succeed in making the lower part of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our work,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;and if we ever see Captain Harding
      again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see him again, Pencroft,&rdquo; cried Herbert, &ldquo;and when he returns he
      must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a
      fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we can, my boy,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;and these Chimneys will serve
      our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I
      think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings,
      through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they began
      to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite rapid, and
      drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide&mdash;and it could already be
      perceived&mdash;must drive it back with force to a considerable distance.
      The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and flow for the
      transport of heavy objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy
      arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.
      From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent
      trees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the
      advanced season, for they belonged to the family of &ldquo;coniferae,&rdquo; which is
      spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to the
      tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the &ldquo;deedara,&rdquo; which
      are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around them a
      most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up clusters of
      firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around. Among the long
      grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry branches which
      crackled like fireworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; said he to Herbert, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t know the name of these
      trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them &lsquo;burning wood,&rsquo; and just
      now that&rsquo;s the chief thing we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get a supply,&rdquo; replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the
      trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet; but
      if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet found.
      The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore necessary
      to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the loads of two men
      would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;there must be some way of carrying
      this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart or
      a boat, it would be easy enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have the river,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;the river will be to us like a road which
      carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; observed Herbert, &ldquo;at this moment our road is going the wrong way,
      for the tide is rising!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;and
      then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get the
      raft ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.
      They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood
      bound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead
      branches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably
      never before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind of
      little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current, the
      sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which they had
      fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on which they
      stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have loaded at
      least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the raft moored to
      the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent
      Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a
      more extended view of the surrounding country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall,
      terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge of
      the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began their
      ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the summit in a
      few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long
      before they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed,
      with emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the
      catastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had
      disappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to which
      a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but one vast
      watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither the reporter
      nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at this time they
      were both too far away to be perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something tells me,&rdquo; cried Herbert, &ldquo;that a man as energetic as Captain
      Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have
      reached some point of the shore; don&rsquo;t you think so, Pencroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus
      Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: &ldquo;Doubtless,
      doubtless,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;our engineer is a man who would get out of a scrape
      to which any one else would yield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched out
      below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river&rsquo;s mouth
      by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like
      amphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea
      sparkled beneath the sun&rsquo;s rays. To the south a sharp point closed the
      horizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that
      direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made
      this coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay the
      outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve.
      There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of
      sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then returned
      towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the snow-topped
      mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles. From its first
      declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread vast masses of
      wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the presence of evergreen
      trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the shore extended a plain,
      scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here and there on the left
      sparkled through glades the waters of the little river; they could trace
      its winding course back towards the spurs of the mountain, among which it
      seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor had left his raft of wood,
      it began to run between the two high granite walls; but if on the left
      bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on the right bank, on the
      contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides changed to isolated rocks,
      the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle running to the extremity of the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we on an island?&rdquo; murmured the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, it seems to be big enough,&rdquo; replied the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect
      survey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island
      or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied in
      its productions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is satisfactory,&rdquo; observed Pencroft; &ldquo;and in our misfortune, we must
      thank Providence for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of
      gratitude to the Author of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which they had
      been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an inspection what
      the future had in store for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite platform,
      bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most whimsical shapes.
      Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the holes of the stone;
      Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole flock of these winged
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;those are not gulls nor sea-mews!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they then?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by the
      double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their
      slate-colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs
      must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in
      their nests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an
      omelet!&rdquo; replied Pencroft merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will you make your omelet in?&rdquo; asked Herbert; &ldquo;in your hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;I am not quite conjuror enough for that; we
      must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to
      despatch the hardest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite, and
      they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being
      collected, were packed in the sailor&rsquo;s handkerchief, and as the time when
      the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began to
      redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was an hour
      after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail themselves
      of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not intend to let
      the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither did he mean to
      embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never at a loss when
      there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft rapidly twisted a
      cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This vegetable cable was
      fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the sailor held it in his hand
      while Herbert, pushing off the raft with a long pole, kept it in the
      current. This succeeded capitally. The enormous load of wood drifted down
      the current. The bank was very equal; there was no fear that the raft
      would run aground, and before two o&rsquo;clock they arrived at the river&rsquo;s
      mouth, a few paces from the Chimneys.

    <h2>
      Chapter 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pencroft&rsquo;s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave
      habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand,
      stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the
      south winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to lead
      out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided into
      three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would scarcely
      have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and there was
      space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which occupied the
      center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking all in all they
      were well pleased with it for want of a better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, &ldquo;our
      companions have found a superior place to ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied the seaman; &ldquo;but, as we don&rsquo;t know, we must work
      all the same. Better to have two strings to one&rsquo;s bow than no string at
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, &ldquo;how jolly it will be if they were to find
      Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;that was a man of the right sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, &ldquo;do you despair of ever seeing him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft
      declared himself very well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our friends can come back when they like. They will find
      a good enough shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper&mdash;an
      easy task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of
      the narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take
      the heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature
      inside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor
      laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with
      this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and I may say happily, for without matches
      or tinder we should be in a fix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still we might get fire as the savages do,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;by rubbing
      two bits of dry stick one against the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; try, my boy, and let&rsquo;s see if you can do anything besides
      exercising your arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of the
      Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;but the savages must know how to do
      it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to get fire
      in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer matches. By
      the bye, where are my matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there,
      for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the
      pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover the
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; said he, looking at Herbert. &ldquo;The box must have fallen out
      of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have something&mdash;a
      tinder-box&mdash;anything that can possibly make fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the rocks,
      near the river&rsquo;s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain. The box
      was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; asked Herbert, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you throw it out of the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew better than that,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;but such a small article
      could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I would
      rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, the tide is going down,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s run to the place
      where we landed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves had
      rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well to try.
      Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had landed the
      day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted there, among
      the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing. If the box had
      fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the waves. As the sea
      went down, they searched every little crevice with no result. It was a
      grave loss in their circumstances, and for the time irreparable. Pencroft
      could not hide his vexation; he looked very anxious, but said not a word.
      Herbert tried to console him by observing, that if they had found the
      matches, they would, very likely, have been wetted by the sea and useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;they were in a copper box which shut
      very tightly; and now what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall certainly find some way of making a fire,&rdquo; said Herbert.
      &ldquo;Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;but in the meantime we are without fire, and our
      companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Herbert quickly, &ldquo;do you think it possible that they have no
      tinder or matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; replied the sailor, shaking his head, &ldquo;for neither Neb nor
      Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep
      his note-book than his match-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be regretted,
      but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or other.
      Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not a man to
      trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate, there was
      only one thing to be done&mdash;to await the return of Neb and the
      reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had
      meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect
      either for themselves or for the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of fire
      being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and then
      silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He even
      climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle where
      the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it in
      every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the
      forest, all in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave. It is
      useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were ransacked
      before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards six o&rsquo;clock,
      when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west, Herbert,
      who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the return of Neb
      and Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were returning alone!... The boy&rsquo;s heart sank; the sailor had not
      been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not
      been found!
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying anything.
      Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength to utter a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he
      could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover
      Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight
      miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen
      the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the disappearance of
      the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary; not a vestige of a
      mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a trace on the sand; not a
      human footstep on all that part of the beach. It was clear that that
      portion of the shore had never been visited by a human being. The sea was
      as deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the
      coast, that the engineer must have found a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which
      showed how hope struggled within him, &ldquo;No! he is not dead! he can&rsquo;t be
      dead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get out
      of anything!&rdquo; Then his strength forsaking him, &ldquo;Oh! I can do no more!&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb,&rdquo; said Herbert, running to him, &ldquo;we will find him! God will give him
      back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which
      was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything for
      several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live without
      his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself
      down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm.
      Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have
      found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is advancing.
      Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On the
      way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he happened
      to have a match or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, &ldquo;I
      had some, but I must have thrown them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, &ldquo;Have you no matches?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one, and no fire in consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Neb, &ldquo;if my master was here, he would know what to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.
      Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, &ldquo;Mr. Spilett, you
      are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven&rsquo;t looked
      well, try again, a single match will be enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and
      great-coat, and at last to Pencroft&rsquo;s great joy, no less to his extreme
      surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his
      waistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could
      not get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great
      importance not to rub off the phosphorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me try?&rdquo; said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking
      it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood
      which was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Pencroft; &ldquo;it is as good as having a whole cargo!&rdquo; He took
      the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are
      wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the
      greatest caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, &ldquo;We must have
      some paper,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his
      note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and
      knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry
      moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air
      could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as
      smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a small,
      rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart, holding his
      breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did not produce any
      effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to rub off the
      phosphorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my hand trembles, the match has missed
      fire; I cannot, I will not!&rdquo; and rising, he told Herbert to take his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus
      going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He
      did not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making a
      choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the
      flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds too
      caught fire, and then the moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted by the
      vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, getting up; &ldquo;I was never so nervous before in
      all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily out
      at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was not
      long in being felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to
      keep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had
      plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft&rsquo;s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more
      nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were brought
      by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these
      preparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his
      mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had
      survived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of
      making known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore. He
      was like a body without a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no choice,
      and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under the hot
      cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman invited the
      reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the first repast of the
      castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs were excellent, and as eggs
      contain everything indispensable to man&rsquo;s nourishment, these poor people
      thought themselves well off, and were much strengthened by them. Oh! if
      only one of them had not been missing at this meal! If the five prisoners
      who escaped from Richmond had been all there, under the piled-up rocks,
      before this clear, crackling fire on the dry sand, what thanksgiving must
      they have rendered to Heaven! But the most ingenious, the most learned, he
      who was their unquestioned chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and
      his body had not even obtained a burial-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard
      the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking on
      the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a
      deafening noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down
      the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the
      loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the
      matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his
      sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he
      passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not spare fuel.
      But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The inconsolable,
      despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions could say to
      induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on the shore calling
      on his master.

      Chapter 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the
      clouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon
      made out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at
      the time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and a
      watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a
      weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they had
      thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes of
      Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked on Juan
      Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in such
      absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their
      stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some things
      were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the first
      necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a utensil.
      From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could have
      brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their
      situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must hope
      no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect nothing
      but from themselves and from that Providence which never abandons those
      whose faith is sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast, without
      trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was inhabited, or if
      they were on the shore of a desert island?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest
      possible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take.
      However, according to Pencroft&rsquo;s advice, it appeared best to wait a few
      days before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some
      provisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs. The
      explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all recruit
      their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was
      lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of
      shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy to
      kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the summit
      of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees of the
      neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly, the sweet
      water was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the
      Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along the
      shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb
      particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he was in
      no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the catastrophe.
      He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus Harding. No, it did
      not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar fashion,
      carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a few hundred feet from a
      shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the body of the engineer, as
      long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes, touched with his hands the
      corpse of his master, he would not believe in his death! And this idea
      rooted itself deeper than ever in his determined heart. An illusion
      perhaps, but still an illusion to be respected, and one which the sailor
      did not wish to destroy. As for him, he hoped no longer, but there was no
      use in arguing with Neb. He was like the dog who will not leave the place
      where his master is buried, and his grief was such that most probably he
      would not survive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on the
      shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot where the
      sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day&rsquo;s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon&rsquo;s eggs and lithodomes.
      Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the hollows of the
      rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany
      Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to hunt.
      But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should remain
      to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable event of
      Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the chase, Herbert,&rdquo; said the sailor. &ldquo;We shall find ammunition on our
      way, and cut our weapons in the forest.&rdquo; But at the moment of starting,
      Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would perhaps be
      prudent to replace it by another substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burnt linen,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;That could in case of need serve for
      tinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the inconvenience
      of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.
      Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of
      Pencroft&rsquo;s large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of a
      half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central
      chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all
      wind and damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the
      breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of
      the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at
      that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout
      branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert rubbed
      smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.
      From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river
      narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over which the
      trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose themselves,
      resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would always lead them
      back to the point from which they started. But the bank was not without
      some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees bent level with
      the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had to break down with
      their sticks. Herbert often glided among the broken stumps with the
      agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the underwood. But Pencroft
      called him back directly, begging him not to wander away. Meanwhile, the
      sailor attentively observed the disposition and nature of the surrounding
      country. On the left bank, the ground, which was flat and marshy, rose
      imperceptibly towards the interior. It looked there like a network of
      liquid threads which doubtless reached the river by some underground
      drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the underwood, which they crossed
      without difficulty. The opposite shore appeared to be more uneven, and the
      valley of which the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible.
      The hill, covered with trees disposed in terraces, intercepted the view.
      On the right bank walking would have been difficult, for the declivities
      fell suddenly, and the trees bending over the water were only sustained by
      the strength of their roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already
      surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw
      traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not
      recognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert&rsquo;s
      opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless
      would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of an
      axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a human
      foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on any land
      in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be
      feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little, for the
      difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and after
      walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile. As yet the
      hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang and fluttered in
      the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had inspired them with an
      instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described, in a marshy part of the
      forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely resembling the
      king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a metallic
      brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a jacamar,&rdquo; said Herbert, trying to get nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,&rdquo; replied the sailor,
      &ldquo;if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on the
      wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and
      disappeared in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How clumsy I am!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my boy!&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;The blow was well aimed; many a one
      would have missed it altogether! Come, don&rsquo;t be vexed with yourself. We
      shall catch it another day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many
      being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in vain
      for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many ways
      in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth
      parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in the
      Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae, such
      as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar to
      those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and splendid firs,
      measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage, with
      long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches strewing
      their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down. Herbert picked
      up a few of these feathers, and after having examined them,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are couroucous,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;still, if
      they are good to eat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,&rdquo; replied
      Herbert. &ldquo;Besides, if I don&rsquo;t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill
      them with a stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot of a
      tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The couroucous
      were waiting the passage of insects which served for their nourishment.
      Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender twigs which
      supported them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed
      down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away, and
      stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were already
      heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;here is game, which is quite within the reach of
      hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs, they
      then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend towards the
      south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the river must have
      its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the melting of the snow
      which covered the sides of the central cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to
      procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of the
      Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not been
      attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he
      exclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize fled
      into the long grass, &ldquo;If only we had had the dog Top!&rdquo; But Top had
      disappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards three o&rsquo;clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain trees,
      at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the juniper-tree
      among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded through the forest.
      This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in
      the United States. They soon saw several couples, whose plumage was rich
      chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail of the same color.
      Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like appendages raised on the
      neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at least one of these
      gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose flesh is better than
      that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they would not allow
      themselves to be approached. After several fruitless attempts, which
      resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor said to the lad,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, since we can&rsquo;t kill them on the wing, we must try to take them
      with a line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a fish?&rdquo; cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a fish,&rdquo; replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found
      among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four eggs.
      He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their proprietors
      would not fail to return. It was around these that he meant to stretch his
      lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took Herbert to some
      distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular apparatus with
      all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would have used. Herbert
      watched the work with great interest, though rather doubting its success.
      The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened one to the other, of the
      length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong thorns, the points bent
      back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia bush) were fastened to the
      ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large red worms, which were
      crawling on the ground, furnished bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself
      skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse
      nests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind a
      large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be said,
      that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several
      couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the
      ground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters, who,
      besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and
      Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if about
      to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice of
      them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the worms
      had been still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the fisherman,
      for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The jerks attracted
      the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the hooks with their
      beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same moment bait and hook.
      Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft &ldquo;struck&rdquo; his line, and a flapping of
      wings showed that the birds were taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself
      master in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen
      birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not
      his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of
      invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at any rate,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;situated as we are, we must hope to hit upon
      many other contrivances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not
      having to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing
      that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their
      dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only to
      follow, and, towards six o&rsquo;clock, tired enough with their excursion,
      Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.

      Chapter 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed,
      gazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in a
      thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith. The wind
      was already strong, and increased with the decline of day. The whole sky
      was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a violent storm
      were clearly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter. The
      latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!&rdquo; said the sailor:
      &ldquo;Petrels delight in wind and rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words
      were,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the waves
      carried off our companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and
      replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two cables lengths at the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is a cable&rsquo;s length?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve
      hundred feet at the most from the shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his dog also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What astonishes me,&rdquo; rejoined the reporter, &ldquo;while admitting that our
      companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that
      neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the shore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
      &ldquo;Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down the
      coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?&rdquo;
       again asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own opinion,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;with due deference to your
      experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute
      disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something
      unaccountable and unlikely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied Pencroft;
      &ldquo;unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.&rdquo; Having said this, the
      sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth.
      Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a
      bright light into the darkest parts of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to
      introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get up
      their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day, but
      they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick, and
      roasting before a blazing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of the
      Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met with
      an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had been
      driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different conclusions
      from this absence. According to him, Neb&rsquo;s delay was caused by some new
      circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search. Also,
      everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had Neb not
      returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found some mark, a
      footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path. Perhaps he was at
      this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was near his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The
      reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most
      probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther than
      the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times
      manifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him that
      that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable
      weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much
      better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day,
      Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor&rsquo;s opinion that it was best not to
      divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large
      tears fell from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over the
      coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was dashed by
      the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor drove along the
      beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if poured out in
      cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as it were mineral
      dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united attack
      insupportable. Between the river&rsquo;s mouth and the end of the cliff, eddies
      of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the water which ran
      through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace was also driven
      back through the opening, filling the passages and rendering them
      uninhabitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away, and
      only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the
      frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have taken
      refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the return
      of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it was
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent, and
      Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very hungry,
      devoured it with infinite satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested
      the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the
      sailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength,
      until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond
      to this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the
      seasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are
      above all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to
      their fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of
      the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was
      composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely
      balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could feel
      rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he repeated
      to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and that their
      retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of stones torn from
      the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on to the beach. A few
      even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys, or flew off in fragments
      when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice the sailor rose and
      intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so as to take a look in
      safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be feared from these
      showers, which were not considerable, and he returned to his couch before
      the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest, the
      thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last took
      possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to anything.
      Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached himself with
      not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not abandoned all
      hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not cease to
      agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why had Neb not
      returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely giving a thought to
      the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his eyes, heavy with fatigue,
      closed for an instant, but some sudden thought reopened them almost
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning,
      when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas
      with the promptitude usual to seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Pencroft, listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those caused
      by the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the wind,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, &ldquo;I thought I heard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The barking of a dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dog!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, springing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;barking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible!&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;And besides, how, in the roaring
      of the storm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop&mdash;listen&mdash;&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during a
      lull, distant barking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the reporter, pressing the sailor&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes!&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Top! It is Top!&rdquo; cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three
      rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in
      getting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and
      could only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked
      about, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky,
      the land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,
      overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they
      found must be at some distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most
      probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made his way
      more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the reporter&rsquo;s
      hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which signified
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; then he reentered the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the
      darkness, whistling shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking immediately
      came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage. Pencroft, Herbert,
      and Spilett entered after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted up
      with a bright flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Top!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these two
      races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which are
      the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the engineer,
      Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master accompanied
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys,
      which he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the midst
      of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more
      inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even
      soiled with mud or sand!&mdash;Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was
      patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the dog is found, the master will be found also!&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it!&rdquo; responded Herbert. &ldquo;Let us set off! Top will guide us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top&rsquo;s arrival
      contradicted his conjectures. &ldquo;Come along then!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few
      pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.
      Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to
      come with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out,
      after having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a
      single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow a
      straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top&rsquo;s instinct. They
      did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the sailor
      brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The rain was
      not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The
      wind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of
      sand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received
      behind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they
      sometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in keeping
      their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at random that
      they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that Neb had found
      his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog. But was the
      engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions that they might
      render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate Harding?
    </p>
    <p>
      After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft
      prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks
      sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or
      rather run of a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having pronounced
      the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as much as to say
      that his master was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; repeated Herbert; &ldquo;saved, Top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the dog barked in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it
      threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows
      thundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed
      entirely over the islet, then quite invisible. The mole no longer
      protected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the open
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind
      struck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they
      walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what
      direction to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable
      extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their right
      a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess. But they
      felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed completely over
      them, without being driven back as it was when it came in contact with the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared about
      five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though less
      damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their clothing,
      Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not a complaint
      escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top, wherever the
      intelligent animal wished to lead them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards five o&rsquo;clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog was
      less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a
      luminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were
      tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the same
      time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though very
      indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and
      his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were
      following a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads
      scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left,
      the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling with
      thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance to the
      ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two or three
      trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in that
      direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned,
      and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the
      beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least
      hesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The
      country appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks and
      even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a Switzerland
      modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have possibly
      recognized the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two
      companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of a
      high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett,
      Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      Neb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped his
      hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his grief,
      evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear to
      the engineer&rsquo;s chest, having first torn open his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute&mdash;an age!&mdash;passed, during which he endeavored to catch
      the faintest throb of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had
      completely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized,
      exhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a throbbing,
      and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found, a
      hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly
      increased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing
      in which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was
      obliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream,
      and with it hastened back to the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only
      wished to wet the engineer&rsquo;s lips. The cold water produced an almost
      immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will save him!&rdquo; exclaimed the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words hope revived in Neb&rsquo;s heart. He undressed his master to see
      if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found, either on
      the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must have been
      dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and it was
      difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the efforts
      which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he
      would say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to
      recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this
      about; so they set to work with the sailor&rsquo;s jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly and
      began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion, and
      certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would have
      been all over with Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought your master was dead, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the seaman to Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! quite dead!&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;and if Top had not found you, and brought
      you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain down on his
      grave to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having left
      the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly
      direction, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already
      visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach, among
      the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He examined
      particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by the high
      tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all marks. Neb did
      not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse that he
      searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been
      visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not
      reached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark,
      were untouched. Not a shell was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was possible
      that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point. When a
      corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely happens that
      the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb knew, and he
      wished to see his master again for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining the
      beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding
      anything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on
      the sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footprints?&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did these footprints begin at the water&rsquo;s edge?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;only above high-water mark, for the others must have
      been washed out by the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Neb,&rdquo; said Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear and
      went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile, running,
      but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as it was getting
      dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top brought me here,
      to my master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the
      inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life. Now
      that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his efforts
      were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last duties to
      the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his companions.
      They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again. Top was
      there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal? Neb
      several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his
      companions whom Top knew best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction
      indicated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost
      as supernatural, Top had found them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb&rsquo;s companions had listened with great attention to this account.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which he
      must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had not
      received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was how
      the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than a
      mile from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Neb,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;it was not you who brought your master to
      this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not I,&rdquo; replied the Negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear that the captain came here by himself,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear in reality,&rdquo; observed Spilett, &ldquo;but it is not credible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer&rsquo;s
      own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had
      re-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm
      again, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear to
      hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by
      movement, his senses had not as yet been restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of procuring
      it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt linen, which
      would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by striking together
      two flints. As to the engineer&rsquo;s pockets, they were entirely empty, except
      that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch. It was necessary to
      carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as possible. This was the
      opinion of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back to
      consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with which
      they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought of
      mixing with the water some moisture from the titra&rsquo;s flesh which he had
      brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large bivalve
      shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced between the
      lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master! my master!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other two
      companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even then,
      troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they were
      the same words he had before attempted to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Island or continent?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the continent,&rdquo; cried Pencroft hastily; &ldquo;there is time enough to
      see about that, captain! we don&rsquo;t care for anything, provided you are
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make
      arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb,
      Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards a
      high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor could
      not help repeating,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Island or continent! To think of that, when at one&rsquo;s last gasp! What a
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions set to
      work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its principal
      branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with these branches
      they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and leaves, they could
      carry the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o&rsquo;clock when they
      returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the
      drowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his
      cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a
      little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;that Captain Harding will be able to
      listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse jelly,&mdash;for
      we have grouse, captain,&rdquo; added he, presenting him with a little of this
      jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided among
      his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were
      suffering extremely from hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for you
      must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house, with
      rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of birds,
      which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as soon as
      you feel strong enough we will carry you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, my friend,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;wait another hour or two, and
      then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the
      events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon,
      the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it
      was, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys, the
      search for him, not forgetting of course Neb&rsquo;s devotion, the intelligence
      exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, &ldquo;you did not, then, pick me
      up on the beach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you not bring me to this cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what distance is this cave from the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a mile,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;and if you are astonished, captain, we
      are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took
      great interest in these details, &ldquo;indeed it is very singular!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed the sailor, &ldquo;can you tell us what happened after you were
      carried off by the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him from
      the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning to the
      surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling near him.
      It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the balloon,
      which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had darted away
      like an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could not
      be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle against
      the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his clothes; but a
      strong current seized him and drove him towards the north, and after half
      an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top with him into the depths. From
      that moment to the moment in which he recovered to find himself in the
      arms of his friends he remembered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; remarked Pencroft, &ldquo;you must have been thrown on to the beach,
      and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your
      footmarks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... of course,&rdquo; replied the engineer, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and you found no
      traces of human beings on this coast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a trace,&rdquo; replied the reporter; &ldquo;besides, if by chance you had met
      with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have
      abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,&rdquo; added the engineer,
      turning to his servant, &ldquo;it was not you who... you can&rsquo;t have had a moment
      of unconsciousness... during which no, that&rsquo;s absurd.... Do any of the
      footsteps still remain?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; replied Neb; &ldquo;here, at the entrance, at the back of the
      mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has
      destroyed the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;will you take my shoe and see if it fits
      exactly to the footprints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided by
      Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus
      remarked to the reporter,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most extraordinary thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly inexplicable!&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about it
      by-and-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment after the others entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about it. The engineer&rsquo;s shoe fitted exactly to the
      footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I
      attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any
      knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having
      dragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were
      lavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting
      for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards twelve o&rsquo;clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could
      now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which
      exhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on
      the sailor, or he would have fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried Pencroft; &ldquo;bring the captain&rsquo;s litter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with
      leaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having taken
      his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards the coast.
      There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but, as they could
      not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop frequently, they
      reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach the Chimneys. The
      wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not rain. Although lying
      down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed the coast, particularly
      inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no doubt, the appearance of
      the country, with its inequalities of ground, its forests, its various
      productions, were impressed on his mind. However, after traveling for two
      hours, fatigue overcame him, and he slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short
      time after at the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was
      sleeping profoundly, and did not awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had quite
      altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred; great
      blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a thick
      carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing over the
      islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous curtain of
      granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away by the violence
      of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across Pencroft&rsquo;s mind. He
      rushed into the passage, but returned almost immediately, and stood
      motionless, staring at his companions.... The fire was out; the drowned
      cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was to have served as
      tinder, had disappeared! The sea had penetrated to the end of the
      passages, and everything was overthrown and destroyed in the interior of
      the Chimneys!

      Chapter 9
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted with
      what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious to
      Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or rather,
      did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert shared in some degree the sailor&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the reporter, he simply replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Pencroft, it&rsquo;s perfectly indifferent to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I repeat, that we haven&rsquo;t any fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor any means of relighting it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say, Mr. Spilett&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Cyrus here?&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire for
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of his
      heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus Harding.
      The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every science, a
      possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with Cyrus in a
      desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town in the United
      States. With him they could want nothing; with him they would never
      despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic eruption would
      destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the depths of the
      Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyrus is here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into
      unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during
      his journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his
      ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the
      grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of
      cooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had
      disappeared. They must consider what was to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There
      they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained
      almost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be
      more beneficial to him than any nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the wind
      shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the sea
      having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain
      places in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had
      become scarcely habitable. The engineer&rsquo;s condition would, therefore, have
      been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him with
      their coats and waistcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes,
      of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach.
      However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed, which he
      gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea at the
      time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order of Fucacae,
      of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous matter, rich and
      nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after having eaten a quantity
      of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which the taste was very
      tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very considerably by the
      natives. &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;the captain will help us soon.&rdquo;
       Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily they had no means of
      defending themselves from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.
      Neb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking
      together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being
      inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only
      incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which are
      emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,
      therefore, did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried
      rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the
      movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into heat,
      according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the boiler of
      a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to be sure,
      but much less so than the operators themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of
      perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this
      way, let them say what they will,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I could sooner light my
      arms by rubbing them against each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle wood
      by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer for the
      purpose, and besides, there is &ldquo;the knack,&rdquo; following the usual
      expression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not &ldquo;the knack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft&rsquo;s ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of wood
      which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them. The hardy
      sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the efforts of the
      lad to succeed where he had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rub, my boy, rub!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rubbing,&rdquo; replied Herbert, laughing, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t pretend to do
      anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be as
      hot as you are, my good Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this night
      at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated, for the
      twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled for so
      small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in one of
      the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did the same,
      while Top slept at his master&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the
      morning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on
      the day before, his first words were:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Island or continent?&rdquo; This was his uppermost thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know anything about it, captain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall know,&rdquo; rejoined Pencroft, &ldquo;when you have guided us into the
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am able to try it,&rdquo; replied the engineer, who, without much
      effort, rose and stood upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital!&rdquo; cried the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel dreadfully weak,&rdquo; replied Harding. &ldquo;Give me something to eat, my
      friends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! we have no fire,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;or rather, captain, we have it no
      longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused the
      engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive attempt to
      procure fire in the savages&rsquo; way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall consider,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and if we do not find some
      substance similar to tinder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will make matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chemicals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chemicals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not more difficult than that,&rdquo; cried the reporter, striking the
      sailor on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went
      out. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea&rsquo;s
      horizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of the
      huge precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on a
      block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and
      sargassum, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all that we have, Captain Harding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, my boy,&rdquo; replied Harding; &ldquo;it will do&mdash;for this morning at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little
      fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat
      refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an
      island, or on a continent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know to-morrow,&rdquo; said the engineer; &ldquo;till then, there is nothing
      to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make it, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a
      mountain which commands the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Spilett, &ldquo;a mountain which must be rather high&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;we will climb to the summit to-morrow, and
      then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till then, I
      repeat, there is nothing to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fire!&rdquo; said the obstinate sailor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will make us a fire!&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;only have a little
      patience, Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, &ldquo;If it depended
      upon you to do it, we wouldn&rsquo;t taste roast meat very soon&rdquo;; but he was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very little
      troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained absorbed
      in thought; then again speaking,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at any
      rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at the
      expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited place,
      or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is inhabited, we
      will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its inhabitants; if it
      is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, nothing could be plainer,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, whether it is an island or a continent,&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett,
      &ldquo;whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say exactly,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but I presume it is some
      land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was blowing
      from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that it could not
      have varied. If the direction has been maintained from the northeast to
      the southwest, we have traversed the States of North Carolina, of South
      Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, itself, in its narrow
      part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot estimate the distance
      traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven thousand miles, and,
      even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter, it must have
      brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava, either on the Pomotous,
      or even, if it had a greater strength than I suppose, to the land of New
      Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct, it will be easy enough to get
      home again. English or Maoris, we shall always find some one to whom we
      can speak. If, on the contrary, this is the coast of a desert island in
      some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall be able to reconnoiter it from the
      summit of that peak which overlooks the country, and then we shall see how
      best to establish ourselves here as if we are never to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo; cried the reporter. &ldquo;You say &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; my dear Cyrus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to put things at the worst at first,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and
      reserve the best for a surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; remarked Pencroft. &ldquo;It is to be hoped, too, that this island,
      if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships; that would
      be really unlucky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the
      ascent of the mountain,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-morrow, captain,&rdquo; asked Herbert, &ldquo;shall you be in a state to bear
      the fatigue of the ascent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;provided you and Pencroft, my boy,
      show yourselves quick and clever hunters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;since you are speaking of game, if on my
      return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it back all the same, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the day
      at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau. Neb,
      Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their store of
      wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or hairy, which
      might come within their reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set out accordingly about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Herbert
      confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that the
      thunder itself came to light it.&rdquo; All three climbed the bank; and arrived
      at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to his two
      companions,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunters,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;There is Top already in quest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will hunt, then,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;and afterwards we can come back
      and collect our wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three sticks
      from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding about among
      the long grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river,
      plunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the same
      trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In certain
      places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited
      considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development,
      that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had
      supposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered
      with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then, the
      glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost
      impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees, without
      any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off branches which
      might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong not to follow the
      watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first excursion, for
      after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself. Top, running under
      the branches, only roused birds which could not be approached. Even the
      couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that the sailor would be
      obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest, in which he had so
      happily performed his grouse fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pencroft,&rdquo; said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, &ldquo;if this is all
      the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won&rsquo;t need a
      large fire to roast it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t the game which will be
      wanting on our return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t believe that he will make fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will blaze, since my master has said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above
      the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully
      marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was edible.
      This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond, very much
      esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These almonds
      were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them to his
      companions, who feasted on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat,
      and almonds for dessert, that&rsquo;s certainly a good dinner for those who have
      not a single match in their pocket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not complaining, my boy,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;only I repeat, that
      meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top has found something!&rdquo; cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the
      midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top&rsquo;s barking were
      mingled curious gruntings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this was
      not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how they were
      to get hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged in a
      struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This quadruped
      was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a blackish brown
      color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes, then strongly
      fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane. Herbert recognized
      in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of the largest members of
      the rodent order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly
      rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to
      fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top&rsquo;s teeth, by which
      it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed
      upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascal!&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined
      him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded by
      venerable pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the
      water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;for he will soon come to the surface to
      breathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he drown?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;since he has webbed feet, and is almost an
      amphibious animal. But watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to
      different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the capybara,
      which the dog was looking for beneath the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the
      surface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from
      plunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was
      killed by a blow from Neb&rsquo;s stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the height
      of the sun that it was about two o&rsquo;clock, he gave the signal to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top&rsquo;s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent
      animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half an
      hour later they arrived at the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if there
      was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the
      current, they returned towards the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again
      uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert! Neb! Look!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.

    <h2>
      Chapter 10
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The
      captain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the
      other, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, my brave fellow,&rdquo; cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we
      will have a feast presently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who lighted it?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which had
      furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could scarcely
      believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of
      questioning the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you a burning-glass, sir?&rdquo; asked Herbert of Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but I made one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was
      simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter&rsquo;s
      watches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive
      by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass,
      which, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused it
      to blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer without
      saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if Cyrus
      Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At last
      speech returned to him, and he cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is noted,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara,
      properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear,
      crackling fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the
      passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and
      mud had been re-established.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their day
      well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and had
      proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,
      accustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time on
      the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The
      mountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to
      measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of an
      observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least fifty
      miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the
      question of &ldquo;island or continent,&rdquo; to which he attached so much
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.
      The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast,
      during which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects
      for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best to
      do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only shook
      his head without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;we shall know what we have to depend upon, and
      we will act accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and the
      inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon buried
      in a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th of
      March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion which
      must determine their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough
      to sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had been
      returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft burned a
      little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be wanting in
      these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in the morning
      when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys. Following
      Pencroft&rsquo;s advice, it appeared best to take the road already traversed
      through the forest, and to return by another route. It was also the most
      direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south angle and followed
      the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at the point where it
      formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path, already trodden under the
      evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o&rsquo;clock Cyrus Harding and his
      companions had reached the western border of the forest. The ground, till
      then, very little undulated, boggy at first, dry and sandy afterwards, had
      a gentle slope, which ascended from the shore towards the interior of the
      country. A few very timid animals were seen under the forest-trees. Top
      quickly started them, but his master soon called him back, for the time
      had not come to commence hunting; that would be attended to later. The
      engineer was not a man who would allow himself to be diverted from his
      fixed idea. It might even have been said that he did not observe the
      country at all, either in its configuration or in its natural productions,
      his great aim being to climb the mountain before him, and therefore
      straight towards it he went. At ten o&rsquo;clock a halt of a few minutes was
      made. On leaving the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared
      before the explorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first,
      truncated at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was
      sustained by buttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of
      an immense claw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys,
      bristling with trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the
      lowest cone. There appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the
      mountain which was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be
      seen which, no doubt, were watercourses.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little
      on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman would
      have said, &ldquo;His bonnet was a thocht ajee.&rdquo; It appeared formed of bare
      earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of
      the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on volcanic ground,&rdquo; Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions
      following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which, by
      a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and
      there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met
      with. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet lower,
      at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost
      impenetrable to the sun&rsquo;s rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints
      which indicated the recent passage of large animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in India,
      and the lion in Africa, &ldquo;we shall soon learn how successfully to encounter
      them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ascended but slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be
      surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell,
      and they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to go
      round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable path,
      much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At twelve
      o&rsquo;clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast at the
      foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in
      cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,
      which most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this point
      the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high
      promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On the
      left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the
      northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short by the
      ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful support of
      the central cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the
      southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade of
      the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the
      pheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin which
      hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted behind
      the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl, the
      female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his red
      plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly
      and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which Pencroft,
      made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on each
      other&rsquo;s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity
      and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil appeared
      volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make the slope more
      easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being exceedingly precarious
      required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert took the lead, Pencroft the
      rear, the captain and the reporter between them. The animals which
      frequented these heights&mdash;and there were numerous traces of them&mdash;must
      necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine, chamois
      or goat. Several were seen, but this was not the name Pencroft gave them,
      for all of a sudden&mdash;&ldquo;Sheep!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size,
      with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a woolly
      fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the
      mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the name
      of the musmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they legs and chops?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, they are sheep!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an
      astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then their
      fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, till we meet again,&rdquo; cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in
      such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb
      could not help laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur
      springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In
      some places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such
      as whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower
      cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four o&rsquo;clock
      the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only remained here
      and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have had a hard life in
      resisting at this altitude the high winds from the open sea. Happily for
      the engineer and his companions the weather was beautiful, the atmosphere
      tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of three thousand feet would
      have hindered their proceedings. The purity of the sky at the zenith was
      felt through the transparent air. A perfect calm reigned around them. They
      could not see the sun, then hid by the vast screen of the upper cone,
      which masked the half-horizon of the west, and whose enormous shadow
      stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its
      diurnal course. Vapor&mdash;mist rather than clouds&mdash;began to appear
      in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors under the influence of
      the solar rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which
      they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night,
      but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles by the
      zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid under their
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the stones
      worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening came on by
      degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his companions,
      much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at the plateau of the
      first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an encampment, and to restore
      their strength by eating first and sleeping afterwards. This second stage
      of the mountain rose on a base of rocks, among which it would be easy to
      find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant. However, a fire could be made by
      means of the moss and dry brushwood, which covered certain parts of the
      plateau. While the sailor was preparing his hearth with stones which he
      put to this use, Neb and Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply
      of fuel. They soon returned with a load of brushwood. The steel was
      struck, the burnt linen caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb&rsquo;s
      breath, a crackling fire showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter
      of the rocks. Their object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to
      withstand the cold temperature of the night, as it was not employed in
      cooking the bird, which Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the
      capybara and some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It
      was not half-past six when all was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large
      circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before
      taking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the
      base of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit
      being inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible
      that from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north, the
      plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain could not
      be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not get round the
      base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the western part of the
      country, and their object in making the ascent would in part be altogether
      unattained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and Neb
      to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the day,
      began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north. Herbert
      accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus
      Harding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In some
      places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without hindrance.
      In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path, in which two
      persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty minutes, Cyrus
      Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point the slope of the
      two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the two parts of the
      mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy degrees, the path
      became impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of
      following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for
      ascending the cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth of the
      crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at the periods
      when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and crusted scoria
      formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which would greatly
      facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed by
      the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing
      obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the
      interior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be seen.
      The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until he was
      stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the volcano
      and favored their ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely
      extinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in the
      dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued from this
      black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the earth. The
      atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous vapor. It was
      more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete extinction. Cyrus
      Harding&rsquo;s attempt would succeed.

      Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior,
      saw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular
      portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.
      At each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered the
      field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the southern sky
      shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid Antares in the
      Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is believed to be the
      nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the crater widened,
      appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle, and lastly, nearly
      at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross, which replaces the
      Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on the
      highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a radius
      of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it connected
      in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not yet be made
      out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the horizon,
      increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky and water
      were blended together in the same circular line.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which
      descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its
      light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached
      from the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for an
      instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad&rsquo;s hand, and in a
      grave voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An island!&rdquo; said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared
      beneath the waves.

      Chapter 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the
      encampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon
      which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they would
      consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep, and in
      that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet above the
      level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders enjoyed profound
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which consisted
      solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb again to the
      summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey the island upon
      which he and his companions were imprisoned for life perhaps, should the
      island be situated at a great distance from any land, or if it was out of
      the course of vessels which visited the archipelagoes of the Pacific
      Ocean. This time his companions followed him in the new exploration. They
      also wished to see the island, on the productions of which they must
      depend for the supply of all their wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,
      Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one appeared
      to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in themselves,
      doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this faith was not
      the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer had confidence,
      because he felt capable of extorting from this wild country everything
      necessary for the life of himself and his companions; the latter feared
      nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them. Pencroft especially,
      since the incident of the relighted fire, would not have despaired for an
      instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on
      the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we left Richmond without permission from the
      authorities! It will be hard if we don&rsquo;t manage to get away some day or
      other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went
      round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of
      the enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure
      sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to
      be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening, to
      a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large
      thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus
      marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which
      furrowed the northern part of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five
      to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.
      Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed
      the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the
      subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated with
      the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to the
      complete extinction of the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before eight o&rsquo;clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the
      summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea, the sea everywhere!&rdquo; they cried, as if their lips could not
      restrain the words which made islanders of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around
      them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus Harding
      had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore, which he had
      not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before. But nothing
      appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to say over a
      radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a sail. Over all
      this immense space the ocean alone was visible&mdash;the island occupied
      the center of a circumference which appeared to be infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for some
      minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme limits.
      Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw nothing; and
      certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it appeared only as an
      indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly have found it out, for
      nature had placed regular telescopes under his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded
      entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what size is this island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the
      perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he
      was placed; then,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the
      shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And consequently an area?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is difficult to estimate,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;for it is so
      uneven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had
      almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at
      the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories,
      points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when Gideon
      Spilett, on the engineer&rsquo;s advice, had drawn the outline, they found that
      it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan, which lay
      sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of consequence
      to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a wide
      bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high point
      from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other capes
      closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the
      half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like the
      flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of
      protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the
      island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken at
      two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in a
      long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty
      miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island,
      already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which marked
      out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek
      on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island
      only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the
      northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less than
      thirty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very woody
      throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and arid and
      sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east coast Cyrus
      Harding and his companions were surprised to see a lake, bordered with
      green trees, the existence of which they had not suspected. Seen from this
      height, the lake appeared to be on the same level as the ocean, but, on
      reflection, the engineer explained to his companions that the altitude of
      this little sheet of water must be about three hundred feet, because the
      plateau, which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a freshwater lake?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;for it must be fed by the water which
      flows from the mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a little river which runs into it,&rdquo; said Herbert, pointing out a
      narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harding; &ldquo;and since this stream feeds the lake, most probably
      on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water
      escapes. We shall see that on our return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned
      constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the
      eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of
      trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest,
      other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such was
      the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent specimens
      of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication of running
      water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant water among the
      marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition to the downs,
      sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant
      vegetation of the rest of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary, in
      the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two zones.
      At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part of the
      spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the contrary,
      one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the sandy plains.
      It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain was in a state of
      eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and a large heap of lava
      had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the
      mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in relief
      with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the sand, blue for
      the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing remained concealed
      but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the
      interior of the volcanic chasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have a
      great effect upon the future of the castaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the island inhabited?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close
      examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of huts,
      not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling in the
      air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of nearly thirty
      miles separated the observers from the extreme points, that is, of the
      tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have been difficult,
      even to Pencroft&rsquo;s eyes, to discover a habitation there. Neither could the
      curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters of the island, be raised
      to see if it did not shelter some straggling village. But in general the
      islanders live on the shores of the narrow spaces which emerge above the
      waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to be an absolute desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island
      was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the
      natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this
      question. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty miles
      could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large Polynesian
      canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island, of its
      isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes. Would
      Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude without
      instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it was best to
      take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its
      features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems
      ascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked in
      a general way on the reporter&rsquo;s plan. They had now only to descend the
      mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of view,
      of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding
      said to them in a calm, grave voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of the
      Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time, perhaps.
      Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes by chance.
      I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there is not even
      a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared that it is
      situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say, too much to
      the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of the Pacific,
      and too much to the north for those which go to Australia by doubling Cape
      Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are right, my dear Cyrus,&rdquo; replied the reporter, with animation.
      &ldquo;You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and you can
      depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will obey you in everything, captain,&rdquo; said Herbert, seizing the
      engineer&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master always, and everywhere!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;if I ever grumble at work, my name&rsquo;s not
      Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America of
      this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start
      telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in order
      and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of the
      Union. Only, I ask one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists, who
      have come here to settle.&rdquo; Harding could not help smiling, and the
      sailor&rsquo;s idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added, that
      he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer. &ldquo;It seems to me it would be a
      good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,
      promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;In the future, that will simplify the
      instructions which we shall have to give and follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;already it is something to be able to say
      where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chimneys, for example,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;That name was the most convenient, and it
      came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for our
      first encampment, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! as for the others, that will be easy,&rdquo; returned the sailor, who was
      in high spirits. &ldquo;Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did, whose
      story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point, Cape
      Disappointment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;of Mr. Spilett,
      of Neb!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name!&rdquo; cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;Port Neb, that would do very well! And Cape
      Gideon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer borrowing names from our country,&rdquo; said the reporter,
      &ldquo;which would remind us of America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for the principal ones,&rdquo; then said Cyrus Harding; &ldquo;for those of the
      bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay on the
      east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on the
      south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing, that of
      Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes, that of
      Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names will recall
      our country, and those of the great citizens who have honored it; but for
      the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we perceive from the top
      of this mountain, rather let us choose names which will recall their
      particular shape. They will impress themselves better on our memory, and
      at the same time will be more practical. The shape of the island is so
      strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine what it resembles. As to
      the streams which we do not know as yet, in different parts of the forest
      which we shall explore later, the creeks which afterwards will be
      discovered, we can christen them as we find them. What do you think, my
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The
      island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to
      give names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write them
      down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be definitely
      adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain, Union Bay,
      Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;to this peninsula at the southwest of the
      island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of
      Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a
      reptile&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adopted,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, &ldquo;let
      us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark
      Gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;and we can complete the resemblance by naming
      the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are two capes,&rdquo; observed the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;we can have North Mandible Cape and South
      Mandible Cape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are inscribed,&rdquo; said Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to be
      named,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, the extremity of Union Bay?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claw Cape,&rdquo; cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some
      part of his domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like the
      powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped island
      represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their
      imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with
      drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of the
      Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the
      castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau
      which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from
      whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of
      Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine
      Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus
      finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh
      discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by
      the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect
      Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the
      rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this
      rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly,
      for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun,
      at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and not in
      the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places
      situated in the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount
      Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! we are preciously stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to
      depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer&rsquo;s name and all his
      companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now
      struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it
      Lincoln Island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their
      absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with
      blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and that
      the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks to
      Grant, thanks to Lincoln!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen
      days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and
      that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.

      Chapter 12

    <p>
      They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater, they
      went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night.
      Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of the
      reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had
      been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an
      instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the
      reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the engineer&rsquo;s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time
      which he had passed on the downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun
      that it must be about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he put his watch at
      that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cyrus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is
      almost that of Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very,
      exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the good of that?&rdquo; thought the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was totally
      exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply
      themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste,
      would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover, the
      sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some powder
      and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no difficulty in
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return
      to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so
      magnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one of
      the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably had its
      source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names which they had
      just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas.
      Herbert and Pencroft&mdash;the one young and the other very boyish&mdash;were
      enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose
      ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or
      whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be
      certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers
      should not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the thick
      forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it was
      prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb
      walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The
      reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note
      every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping
      aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance,
      which he put into his pocket, without making any remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he be picking up?&rdquo; muttered Pencroft. &ldquo;I have looked in vain for
      anything that&rsquo;s worth the trouble of stooping for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards ten o&rsquo;clock the little band descended the last declivities of
      Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and
      trees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a plain
      of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood. Great
      blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred
      and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in
      some places. However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread
      more particularly over the northern slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the
      creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the
      plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the sailor
      were hiding behind the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my boy?&rdquo; asked Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoke,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred
      paces from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men in this place?&rdquo; cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to
      deal,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;I trust that there are no natives on this
      island; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top is on before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t bark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange. However, we must try to call him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined
      their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the
      heaps of basalt.
    </p>
    <p>
      From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter,
      signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the rocks.
      The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this
      exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward. They
      soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor which
      impregnated the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what the
      smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.
      There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;What a pity that I haven&rsquo;t got a cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the
      smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly
      between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid odor,
      after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch. He
      tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he
      estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on what
      he based this calculation,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its quite simple, my boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for, in plunging my hand into the
      water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the
      same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they
      proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some hundred
      paces off.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear and
      limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed the
      presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek was
      immediately given to the watercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain water,
      which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over the sand,
      there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade, ran towards
      the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth varying from
      thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that
      those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance, in the event of
      their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of the
      creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound in
      the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those
      coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored to some
      miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the commencement of
      the month of April, which represents the month of October, in this
      hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they were still in full
      leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of
      which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the
      East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which were
      also covered with the high grass called &ldquo;tussac&rdquo; in New Holland; but the
      cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, seemed to be
      wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless, being too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;such a useful tree, and which has such
      beautiful nuts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti
      and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings. Black,
      white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors,
      kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories, and
      various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism, fluttering
      about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange concert of
      discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The settlers heard
      successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and a sort of
      clacking which they might have believed to have escaped from the lips of a
      native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most
      elementary principles of prudence. Happily, they found there, neither a
      formidable wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely half a dozen
      mocking and singing birds, known as mountain pheasants. A few skillful
      blows from a stick soon put an end to their concert, and procured
      excellent food for the evening&rsquo;s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings, some
      superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at
      Port-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and
      magpies which flew away in flocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these birds,
      but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and these
      primitive weapons proved very insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of
      quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular flying
      mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a height, that
      one would have thought that they passed from one tree to another like
      squirrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kangaroos!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they good to eat?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stewed,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;their flesh is equal to the best venison!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor,
      followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus Harding
      called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters to pursue
      such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a chase of
      five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all sight of
      the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more successful
      than his masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had rejoined
      them, &ldquo;Captain, you see quite well we can&rsquo;t get on unless we make a few
      guns. Will that be possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but we will begin by first manufacturing
      some bows and arrows, and I don&rsquo;t doubt that you will become as clever in
      the use of them as the Australian hunters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bows and arrows!&rdquo; said Pencroft scornfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well for
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be proud, friend Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;Bows and arrows
      were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood. Powder is but
      a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human race&mdash;unhappily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, that&rsquo;s true, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;and I always speak
      too quickly. You must excuse me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History,
      reverted to the kangaroos, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most difficult
      to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not mistaken,
      there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat kangaroos,
      which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there are about a
      dozen species.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; replied the sailor sententiously, &ldquo;there is only one species of
      kangaroos to me, that is &lsquo;kangaroo on the spit,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s just the one we
      haven&rsquo;t got this evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft&rsquo;s new classification. The
      honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the
      singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted
      everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even
      probable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none would
      be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account; but Neb
      watched him and he did well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards three o&rsquo;clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings
      showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed
      after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten
      seconds later would have been past recognizing in Top&rsquo;s stomach. But
      fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he was
      devouring, two other rodents&mdash;the animals in question belonged to
      that order&mdash;lay strangled on the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand. Their
      size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled with green
      spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these
      rodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their
      congeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long ears,
      jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the agouti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;the roast has arrived! and now we can go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of
      the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuarinas, banksias, and gigantic
      gum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other
      arborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the
      stream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that they
      would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a thick
      clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place
      was well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of
      nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed in
      a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain of
      verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of sea.
      The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp outline
      of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this
      little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American namesake were
      represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred feet
      from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several couples of
      kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching for fish, then
      darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and reappeared with their
      prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the islets, strutted wild ducks,
      pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a
      brush, and one or two specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which
      expands gracefully like a lyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from
      certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other on
      the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lake is really beautiful!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;We could live on
      its borders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will live there!&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way,
      descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the
      lake&rsquo;s bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path through
      the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the hand of
      men, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at the north of
      Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction, and then,
      after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the plateau,
      carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely
      for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by the
      first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how and where
      the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the exploration was
      prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards the north. It was
      most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and doubtless through a
      cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short, an immense center
      basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must
      necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so, the engineer
      thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this fall and borrow
      its power, actually lost without profit to any one. They continued then to
      follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the plateau; but, after having
      gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding had not been able to discover
      the overfall, which, however, must exist somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was
      necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little
      band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy,
      Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of cooks
      naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the other in
      that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which they did
      great justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about to
      give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little
      specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is
      lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business
      to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations.&rdquo;

      Chapter 13
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain, where are we going to begin?&rdquo; asked Pencroft next morning
      of the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin &ldquo;at the very beginning.&rdquo;
       They did not possess even the tools necessary for making tools, and they
      were not even in the condition of nature, who, &ldquo;having time, husbands her
      strength.&rdquo; They had no time, since they had to provide for the immediate
      wants of their existence, and though, profiting by acquired experience,
      they had nothing to invent, still they had everything to make; their iron
      and their steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their
      earthenware in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the
      state of textile material.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said, however, that the settlers were &ldquo;men&rdquo; in the complete and
      higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been
      seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and zeal.
      He had tried them. He knew their abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to be
      able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head and
      hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from any
      task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till then
      had only been a pleasure to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural
      sciences, would render greater service to the common cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable, robust,
      with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge, and could
      not fail to be very useful in the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the dockyards
      in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state, gardener,
      cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen, fit for
      anything, he knew how to do everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to struggle
      against fate, more certain to triumph over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning,&rdquo; Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which
      the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve
      to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in these
      transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for immediate
      use, an oven must be built to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this oven for?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make the pottery which we have need of,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what shall we make the oven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With bricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the bricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish
      our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions, and
      there will be no lack of fire to cook the food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the reporter; &ldquo;but if there is a lack of food for want of
      instruments for the chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if we only had a knife!&rdquo; cried the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be plenty
      of game in the larder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a knife, a sharp blade.&rdquo; said the engineer, as if he was speaking to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the shore.
      Suddenly Harding&rsquo;s face became animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top, here,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog came at his master&rsquo;s call. The latter took Top&rsquo;s head between his
      hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he
      broke it in two, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two knives, Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top&rsquo;s collar was made of a thin
      piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of
      sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was
      abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the
      colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid
      handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It was
      indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one. They
      set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of the
      lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which he
      possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy,
      traversed Prospect Heights, and after a walk of five miles or more they
      reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the
      Indians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the
      crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long
      straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped,
      stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing
      remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string. This
      was the &ldquo;hibiscus heterophyllus,&rdquo; which furnishes fibers of such
      remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of
      animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he
      only wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches,
      without knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is to
      say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so
      easily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance
      would do the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day
      before. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks
      and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was no great
      difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand, then to mold
      the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself
      with making them by hand. All that day and the day following were employed
      in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet and hands
      of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal size. A
      practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten thousand bricks
      in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on
      Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand, which were ranged
      near each other, until the time when their complete desiccation would
      permit them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or
      four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing the
      orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot where the
      sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when the sun
      disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the refraction. This
      morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which it reappeared.
      Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four minutes passed.
      Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on this day
      would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied
      at this moment would be the north. At the said hour, Cyrus marked this
      point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him
      for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior
      operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in collecting
      fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked up all the
      fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with greater
      success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp
      points. It was Top who had furnished these points, by bringing in a
      porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to the
      quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the ends
      of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some
      cockatoos&rsquo; feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful
      archers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys,
      capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these
      animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the
      Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of the
      bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first
      exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by
      smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with
      sweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening,
      was always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted to
      hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot could
      be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these excursions, which were not extended far from the brick-field,
      the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of a large size,
      armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize the species. Cyrus
      Harding advised them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed
      many dangerous beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal
      which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack them, or
      they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon as he could
      get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft
      begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war against the
      ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for the
      engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient
      dwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves on
      the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired workers
      slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from
      that time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday,
      was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were
      collected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform the
      operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open air,
      and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous
      kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared fagots, was
      laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried bricks, which
      soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which they contrived
      air-holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till the evening that
      they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night, all watching
      carefully to keep up the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then
      became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time
      Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of
      interlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones, which
      were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when
      decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by
      slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination
      of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April, the
      engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some
      thousands of bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of a
      kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic use.
      They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln was
      supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to the
      sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped from a
      chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a manufactory,
      and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln would
      issue all the products of modern industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common pottery
      in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to which Harding
      added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular &ldquo;pipe-clay,&rdquo; with
      which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones of a proper size,
      great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of these objects was
      clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked in a high temperature,
      the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a number of utensils, as
      precious to the settlers as the most beautifully enameled china. We must
      mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was
      worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some large pipes, which he thought
      charming, but for which, alas! he had no tobacco, and that was a great
      privation to Pencroft. &ldquo;But tobacco will come, like everything else!&rdquo; he
      repeated, in a burst of absolute confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed.
      The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When it
      suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become smiths.
      But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all agreed to
      sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men, scrupulous
      observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation could not but
      develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys,
      carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until they
      could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate
      incident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder. It is
      known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain mushroom of
      the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely inflammable,
      especially when it has been previously saturated with gunpowder, or boiled
      in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash. But, till then, they had
      not found any of these polypores or even any of the morels which could
      replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging to the
      wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe, balm-mint,
      tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting them to the
      sailor, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Pencroft, this will please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair,
      the leaves being clothed with soft down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, captain?&rdquo; asked Pencroft. &ldquo;Is it tobacco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned,
      but to us it will be tinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very
      inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had
      impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed
      several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti
      soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of
      the &ldquo;caladium macrorhizum,&rdquo; an herbaceous plant of the arum family. They
      had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something similar
      to the substance which is sold in England under the name of &ldquo;Portland
      sago&rdquo;; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the settlers in
      Lincoln Island did not yet possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions went
      to take the air on the beach. It was eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening; the
      night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days before, had
      not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those soft, pale
      shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the southern zenith
      glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all the Southern
      Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of
      Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which
      has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at its
      left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the third
      magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after some minutes thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; he asked of the lad, &ldquo;is not this the 15th of April?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in the
      year in which the real time is identical with average time; that is to
      say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will pass the
      meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine I think that
      I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an approximation of some
      degrees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without instruments, without sextant?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;Also, since the night is clear, I will try,
      this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the height of the
      Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the horizon. You
      understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work of installation
      in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this land is an island;
      we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance it is situated,
      either from the American continent or Australia, or from the principal
      archipelagoes of the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;instead of building a house it would be
      more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a
      hundred miles from an inhabited coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why,&rdquo; returned Harding, &ldquo;I am going to try this evening to
      calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I will
      try to calculate the longitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the
      angular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there
      would have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the height
      of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the meridian, he
      would obtain the position of the island. But as they had not one he would
      have to supply the deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two
      little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form a
      pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The
      fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the wood
      pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach, but as
      it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear
      horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern
      horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best
      would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but the
      Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding
      resolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights,
      taking into consideration its height above the level of the sea&mdash;a
      height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of
      elementary geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of
      the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and
      southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which
      sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of the
      island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon in a
      semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon,
      lighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an
      inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to the
      southern pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the
      Polar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven
      degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for it in
      his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it passed
      the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the other
      to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular distance
      which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the angle
      obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a third placed
      transversely, so that their separation should be properly maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the
      observation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the
      depression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height of
      the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha, and
      consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the
      latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is
      always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o&rsquo;clock every one
      was sleeping soundly.

    <p>
      The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued
      from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The
      engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the
      necessary materials&mdash;soda or potash, fat or oil. The important
      question of renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time
      and place. At any rate their clothes would last at least six months
      longer, for they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor.
      But all would depend on the situation of the island with regard to
      inhabited land. This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one of
      those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by
      measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used
      yesterday?&rdquo; said Herbert to the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;we are going to proceed differently,
      but in as precise a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to
      the beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied
      themselves in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet
      long, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with
      his own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb-line
      which Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened to
      the end of a flexible fiber. Having reached a spot about twenty feet from
      the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff, which
      rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into the sand, and
      wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the plumb-line, to erect
      it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand, his
      eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the
      cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then addressing Herbert&mdash;&ldquo;Do you know the first principles of
      geometry?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slightly, captain,&rdquo; replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Herbert; &ldquo;their homologous sides are proportional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled triangles;
      the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular pole, the
      distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the pole and my
      visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides the perpendicular
      cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the distance which
      separates the little stick from the bottom of the cliff, and my visual ray
      also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be prolongation of that of the
      first triangle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, captain, I understand!&rdquo; cried Herbert. &ldquo;As the distance from the
      stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the
      cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Herbert,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;and when we have measured the
      two first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have a
      sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff, and
      will save us the trouble of measuring it directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose
      length above the sand was exactly ten feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place where
      the pole was thrust into the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was five
      hundred feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the
      Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one of
      his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy to trace
      figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the following proportions:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          15:500::10:x

         500 x 10 = 5000

        5000 / 15 = 333.3
</pre>
    <p>
      From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening
      before, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance between
      the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the opening of
      this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal parts. Now,
      this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which separated Alpha
      from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of the sea the
      height of the cliff on which the observation had been made, was found to
      be fifty-three degrees. These fifty-three degrees being subtracted from
      ninety degrees&mdash;the distance from the pole to the equator&mdash;there
      remained thirty-seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded, therefore, that
      Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree of the southern
      latitude, or taking into consideration through the imperfection of the
      performance, an error of five degrees, that it must be situated between
      the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the
      island would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same
      day, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an
      exploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of the
      lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their
      discoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible. They would
      breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel.
      On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely strutting.
      They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much resembles the
      braying of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in an eatable point of
      view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their flesh, though blackish,
      is not bad food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand; seals,
      doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of refuge. It
      was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary point of view,
      for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus Harding observed them
      attentively, and without making known his idea, he announced to his
      companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the islet. The beach
      was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would have rejoiced the
      heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the phasianella, the
      terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was the discovery, by
      Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the rocks, nearly five miles
      from the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb will not have lost his day,&rdquo; cried Pencroft, looking at the spacious
      oyster-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really a fortunate discovery,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and as it is
      said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs,
      we shall have an inexhaustible supply there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Harding. &ldquo;The oyster contains very little nitrogen, and if a
      man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than fifteen
      to sixteen dozen a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;We might swallow dozens and dozens without
      exhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would be
      approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs. They
      put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had manufactured,
      and which already contained food; they then continued to climb the coast
      between the downs and the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in
      time for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point which
      closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South Mandible.
      Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with debris of
      lava. A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls, great
      albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great fancy.
      He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result, for they
      seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we
      shall never get anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;but it depends on you.
      Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter.
      coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate,
      and lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;we might, no doubt, find all these substances
      on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs very
      particular tools. However, we shall see later!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;were we obliged to throw overboard all the weapons
      we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our pocket-knives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have
      thrown us to the bottom of the sea!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is true, my boy,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then passing to another idea,&mdash;&ldquo;Think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how astounded
      Jonathan Forster and his companions must have been when, next morning,
      they found the place empty, and the machine flown away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,&rdquo; said
      the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my idea, that!&rdquo; said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A splendid idea, Pencroft!&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, &ldquo;and which
      has placed us where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,&rdquo; cried the
      sailor, &ldquo;especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and
      join us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I, truly!&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;Besides, what do we want?
      Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is not&mdash;everything!&rdquo; replied Pencroft, laughing and
      shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;But, some day or other, we shall find means of
      going away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,&rdquo; remarked the engineer,
      &ldquo;if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island, or
      from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the
      Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its
      southern part. The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New Zealand
      to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the east. But
      between these two countries, there is a distance of at least six thousand
      miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point in this great space
      the island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently, with a
      sufficient approximation, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in
      latitude?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but the distance which separates us from it
      is more than twelve hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that way?&rdquo; asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme
      interest, pointing to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That way, nothing,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, indeed,&rdquo; added the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cyrus,&rdquo; asked the reporter, &ldquo;if Lincoln Island is not more than two
      or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;instead of building a house we will build a
      boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; cried the sailor, &ldquo;I am quite ready to be captain&mdash;as
      soon as you can make a craft that&rsquo;s able to keep at sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do it, if it is necessary,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking, the
      hour approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus
      Harding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of
      the island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from
      that part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his
      enigmatical preservation. They halted at this place and prepared for
      breakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert went for some fresh water
      from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which Neb had
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical
      observation. He chose a clear place on the shore, which the ebbing tide
      had left perfectly level. This bed of fine sand was as smooth as ice, not
      a grain out of place. It was of little importance whether it was
      horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the stick six feet
      high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On the contrary, the
      engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to say, in the direction
      of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must not be forgotten that the
      settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was situated in the Southern
      Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its diurnal arc above the
      northern, and not above the southern horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to ascertain
      the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the meridian of the
      island or, in other words, determine due south. It was by means of the
      shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for want of an
      instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result which he
      wished to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length
      would be exactly twelve o&rsquo;clock, and it would be enough to watch the
      extremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, after having
      successively diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his stick to
      the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow longer, and
      consequently its modifications would be more easily ascertained. In fact,
      the longer the needle of a dial is, the more easily can the movement of
      its point be followed. The shadow of the stick was nothing but the needle
      of a dial. The moment had come, and Cyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and
      with little wooden pegs, which he stuck into the sand, he began to mark
      the successive diminutions of the stick&rsquo;s shadow. His companions, bending
      over him, watched the operation with extreme interest. The reporter held
      his chronometer in his hand, ready to tell the hour which it marked when
      the shadow would be at its shortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was
      working on the 16th of April, the day on which the true and the average
      time are identical, the hour given by Gideon Spilett would be the true
      hour then at Washington, which would simplify the calculation. Meanwhile
      as the sun slowly advanced, the shadow slowly diminished, and when it
      appeared to Cyrus Harding that it was beginning to increase, he asked,
      &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute past five,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had now only
      to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be seen that
      there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours between the
      meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was
      midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o&rsquo;clock in the evening
      in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement round the earth,
      traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen degrees an hour. Fifteen
      degrees multiplied by five hours give seventy-five degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, since Washington is 77deg 3&rsquo; 11&rdquo; as much as to say seventy-seven
      degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans take
      for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the English&mdash;it
      followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and seventy-five
      degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say, on the hundred
      and fifty-second degree of west longitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into
      consideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he
      believed he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island
      was between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and between
      the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth meridian to the
      west of the meridian of Greenwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was,
      it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles to a
      degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and
      longitude for the exact position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this error would not influence the determination which it was
      necessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a
      distance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to
      attempt to reach one in a frail boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from
      Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than
      eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand five
      hundred miles from the American coast!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in any
      way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the
      situation assigned to Lincoln Island.

      Chapter 15
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor&rsquo;s first words were addressed
      to Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what shall we do to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the captain pleases,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till then the engineer&rsquo;s companions had been brickmakers and potters, now
      they were to become metallurgists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point of
      Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long
      series of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There were
      no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and capricious
      border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two capes, formed of
      mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at this point the
      settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered the Chimneys; but
      they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think
      of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous
      Island was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it, especially
      at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly declared this.
      Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary tools, was a
      difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they must begin by
      making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc., which would take
      some time. It was decided, therefore, that they would winter at Lincoln
      Island, and that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than the
      Chimneys, in which to pass the winter months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron ore,
      of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest part of
      the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or into steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the most
      part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case with the
      two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of magnetic iron,
      not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret of iron. It was,
      therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must reduce with coal,
      that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in a pure state. This
      reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to a high temperature,
      either by the rapid and easy Catalan method, which has the advantage of
      transforming the ore into iron in a single operation, or by the blast
      furnace, which first smelts the ore, then changes it into iron, by
      carrying away the three to four per cent. of coal, which is combined with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as
      possible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and rich.
      It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a deep
      gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the regular
      octahedron. Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron of the first
      quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and Norway are so
      abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein of coal already
      made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the manufacture being
      close together would greatly facilitate the treatment of the ore. This is
      the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great Britain, where the coal aids
      the manufacture of the metal extracted from the same soil at the same time
      as itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;we are going to work iron ore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and for that&mdash;something
      which will please you&mdash;we must begin by having a seal hunt on the
      islet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A seal hunt!&rdquo; cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;Are
      seals needed to make iron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Cyrus has said so!&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared for
      the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were soon
      collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford passable
      at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it without getting wet
      higher than the knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions
      for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them. The
      hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they were
      not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to frighten
      the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths off. They also
      respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings were reduced to the
      state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented with feathers of a scaly
      appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently advanced towards the north
      point, walking over ground riddled with little holes, which formed nests
      for the sea-birds. Towards the extremity of the islet appeared great black
      heads floating just above the water, having exactly the appearance of
      rocks in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary, however,
      first to allow them to land, for with their close, short hair, and their
      fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is difficult to catch
      them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed feet prevent their
      having more than a slow, waddling movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till
      they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send
      them to sleep. They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock
      them on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could count
      half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of the islet,
      so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat. During this
      time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the rocks, glided
      towards the future scene of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted. The
      engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the
      seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest regained
      the sea in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the seals required, captain!&rdquo; said the sailor, advancing towards
      the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; replied Harding. &ldquo;We will make bellows of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bellows!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;Well! these are lucky seals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of the ore
      that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the amphibious
      creatures. They were of a medium size, for their length did not exceed six
      feet. They resembled a dog about the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the
      animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus
      Harding and the reporter continued to explore the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three hours
      afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals&rsquo; skins, which he
      intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any tanning
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the channel
      they entered the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means of
      fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape.
      Cyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top&rsquo;s collar, and
      yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much
      intelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony&rsquo;s stock of
      tools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air into
      the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat&mdash;an
      indispensable condition to the success of the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 20th of April began the &ldquo;metallic period,&rdquo; as the
      reporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been
      said, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to
      his observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast
      spurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from
      their home. It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the
      Chimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a hut
      of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night and
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the
      bellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which they
      besides could renew on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from
      southeast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to beat
      a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to Prospect
      Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to the species already
      discovered, were magnificent. Herbert found some new ones, among others
      some which Pencroft called &ldquo;sham leeks&rdquo;; for, in spite of their size, they
      were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive, shallot, or
      asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when cooked, are
      excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable liquor is made.
      They therefore made a good store of the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so
      allowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who took
      special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood, putting
      up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two kangaroos with
      bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly resembled both a
      hedgehog and an ant-eater. It was like the first because it rolled itself
      into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the second because it had sharp
      claws, a long slender snout which terminated in a bird&rsquo;s beak, and an
      extendible tongue, covered with little thorns which served to hold the
      insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when it is in the pot,&rdquo; asked Pencroft naturally, &ldquo;what will it be
      like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent piece of beef,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not ask more from it,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did not
      offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would not meet
      with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood, the reporter
      thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower branches of a tree,
      an animal which he took for a bear, and which he very tranquilly began to
      draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in question did not belong to
      the redoubtable family of the plantigrades. It was only a koala, better
      known under the name of the sloth, being about the size of a large dog,
      and having stiff hair of a dirty color, the paws armed with strong claws,
      which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the leaves. Having identified
      the animal, which they did not disturb, Gideon Spilett erased &ldquo;bear&rdquo; from
      the title of his sketch, putting koala in its place, and the journey was
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.
      They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs
      which supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some
      hundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh water
      was within their reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the
      forest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers, and
      pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological
      researches were put off till the next day. Supper was prepared, a good
      fire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o&rsquo;clock, while
      one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild beasts
      should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert,
      went to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already
      discovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the
      source of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs. This
      ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly
      suited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ;
      that is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in Corsica. In
      fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the construction of
      kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal, placed in alternate
      layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus Harding intended to
      economize these constructions, and wished simply to form, with the ore and
      the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he would direct the wind
      from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding employed by Tubalcain,
      and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world. Now that which had
      succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which still yielded good results
      in countries rich in ore and fuel, could not but succeed with the settlers
      in Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the surface
      of the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces, and cleansed
      them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their surface. Then
      coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive layers, as the
      charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to carbonize. In this
      way, under the influence of the air projected by the blowing-machine, the
      coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then into oxide of carbon,
      its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is to say, to rid it of
      the oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its
      extremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated in
      the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore. Using the
      mechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise, he
      threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the temperature
      also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce in time pure
      iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the
      settlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump
      of iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle and
      fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied
      veinstone. These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were
      in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did
      what, no doubt, he had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge
      the second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but useful
      metal. At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th of April
      several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools, crowbars,
      pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb declared to be
      real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most serviceable state, that
      is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron and coal, which is
      extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from it the excess of
      coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which was wanting. The
      first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal, gives natural or
      puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation of the iron, gives
      steel of cementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed
      iron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered coal
      in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay suitable
      for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold, with
      the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets, which,
      heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an
      excellent temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured;
      blades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed into
      saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails, etc. At
      last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths returned to
      the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take a fresh
      title.

    <h2>
      Chapter 16
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in
      the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for
      some days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter.
      However, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade
      thermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an
      average of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising,
      since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and
      fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the
      same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece
      and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would
      Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was advisable to
      provide against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would
      begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the elements,
      in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably terrible. The
      question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys must therefore
      be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he had
      discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The
      Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances which
      are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things
      with his companions, &ldquo;we have some precautions to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? The island is not inhabited,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probable,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;although we have not yet
      explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that
      dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a possible
      attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night, or to keep
      up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything. We are here
      in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay pirates&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;at such a distance from land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;These pirates are bold sailors as
      well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;we will fortify ourselves against savages with
      two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will it not
      be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking anything
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be best,&rdquo; added Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns
      which we have searched for in vain here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but you forget, my friends, that it
      will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a
      watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not see
      towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we are
      placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be
      neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not
      exposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere blow
      from the northwest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;let us build a house on the edge of
      the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been
      brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to be
      masons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider the
      matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work, and would
      be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against enemies from
      the interior as those from outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Cyrus,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;but we have already examined
      all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a cranny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not one!&rdquo; added Pencroft. &ldquo;Ah, if we were able to dig out a dwelling
      in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach of harm,
      that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks seaward,
      five or six rooms&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With windows to light them!&rdquo; said Herbert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a staircase to climb up to them!&rdquo; added Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are laughing,&rdquo; cried the sailor, &ldquo;and why? What is there impossible
      in what I propose? Haven&rsquo;t we got pickaxes and spades? Won&rsquo;t Captain
      Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn&rsquo;t it true,
      captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his
      fanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was
      Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them
      at their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by
      proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the
      river to the angle which terminated it on the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme care,
      over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare, straight
      cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons which
      fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the very
      top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either
      with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it
      was not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the
      shore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to say,
      the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle
      of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the
      shore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed a
      sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound together
      by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only forty-five
      degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were also carpeted
      with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend far, and a long, sandy
      plain, which began at the foot of these slopes, reached to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake
      must overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red Creek
      must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had not yet
      found this channel on any part of the shore already explored, that is to
      say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to
      return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern and
      eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few
      minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon
      Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of
      the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted on
      the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black against
      the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant cockatoos
      screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one bough to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake, made
      a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth of the
      creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a half.
      Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable space
      between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point, and
      vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of the
      Creek and the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great
      care. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only
      weapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that
      these animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the
      settlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake
      of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb
      killed it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile,
      and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond
      serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible
      that others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with
      forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes,
      furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great rapidity.
      Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase with such
      eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called him back
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake,
      was soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the point
      which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Harding
      ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was
      considerable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the
      escape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could
      be discovered, would be of great use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other, began
      to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water appeared to
      be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some fishing-rods, so as to
      try and catch some.
    </p>
    <p>
      The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed
      that the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the
      lake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of
      this were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank,
      which, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and
      there, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was viewed
      from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the surface of its
      waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of birds of different
      kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with arrows. One was hit
      by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top rushed forward, and
      brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color, short beak, very
      developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It was a &ldquo;coot,&rdquo; the
      size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls which
      form the transition between the order of wading birds and that of
      palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from pleasant. But
      Top was not so particular in these things as his masters, and it was
      agreed that the coot should be for his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they
      would not be long in reaching the part which they already knew. The
      engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the discharge
      of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he could not
      conceal his astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of
      agitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the
      shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if he
      was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and was
      suddenly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention
      to Top&rsquo;s behavior; but the dog&rsquo;s barking soon became so frequent that the
      engineer noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there, Top?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then
      rushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Top!&rdquo; cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture into
      the treacherous water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening down there?&rdquo; asked Pencroft, examining the surface of
      the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top smells some amphibious creature,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An alligator, perhaps,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; replied Harding. &ldquo;Alligators are only met with in
      regions less elevated in latitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Top had returned at his master&rsquo;s call, and had regained the
      shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass,
      and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which
      was slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water was
      calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers
      stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared. There
      was some mystery there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us pursue this exploration to the end,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the
      lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of
      the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able
      to discover how and where the waters were discharged. &ldquo;There is no doubt
      this overflow exists,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and since it is not visible it must
      go through the granite cliff at the west!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?&rdquo; asked
      Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considerable importance,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;for if it flows through
      the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy to render
      habitable after turning away the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the bottom
      of the lake,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;and that it reaches the sea by some
      subterranean passage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and should it be so we shall be
      obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the
      Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury, and
      before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time into
      the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off,
      and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the
      water, which did not appear to be deep in that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the tapering
      head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches, belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lamantin!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of cetaceans,
      which bear the name of the &ldquo;dugong,&rdquo; for its nostrils were open at the
      upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the dog, who tried
      to escape by returning towards the shore. His master could do nothing to
      save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their
      bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had disappeared beneath the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top&rsquo;s help, and
      attack the dangerous animal in its own element.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Neb,&rdquo; said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable
      struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and judging
      by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle, and
      could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But suddenly, in the
      middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in the air by some
      unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the lake, fell again
      into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon gained the shore,
      without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not
      less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on.
      Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having
      released the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last
      long. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong,
      emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on a
      little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it.
      The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet
      long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its
      neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible blow
      had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much
      interested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the
      Chimneys.

    <h2>
      Chapter 17
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to
      prepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft
      ascended by the river, to renew their store of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the
      dugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass of
      flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to keep the
      fat for the use of the colony. As to the animal&rsquo;s flesh it would furnish
      excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere,
      it is especially reserved for the table of the native princes. But that
      was Neb&rsquo;s affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested in
      the incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery of that
      submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given the
      dugong so strange a wound. He remained at the edge of the lake, looking,
      observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters, which sparkled
      in the first rays of the rising sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was tolerably
      shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped gradually, and
      it was probable that the depth was considerable in the center. The lake
      might be considered as a large center basin, which was filled by the water
      from the Red Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cyrus,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;there seems to be nothing suspicious in
      this water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Spilett,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and I really do not know how
      to account for the incident of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge,&rdquo; returned Spilett, &ldquo;that the wound given this creature is,
      at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was so
      vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a
      powerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed the
      dugong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; &ldquo;there is
      something there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand
      either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself&mdash;how I was
      drawn from the waves, and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I
      feel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall
      discover some day. Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular
      incidents before our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves, and
      continue our work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to
      discover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must
      exist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong current at this
      place. By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the
      southern angle. He followed the current, and arrived at the south point of
      the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly
      lost in some fissure in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very
      distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, rising, &ldquo;is the discharge of the water; there,
      doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through
      cavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging it
      into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large hole
      one foot only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the opening
      so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was such that the
      branch was torn from the engineer&rsquo;s hands and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt about it now,&rdquo; repeated Harding. &ldquo;There is the outlet,
      and I will lay it open to view!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will you lower the level?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By opening another outlet larger than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what place, Cyrus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the part of the bank nearest the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a mass of granite!&rdquo; observed Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;I will blow up the granite, and the water
      escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,&rdquo; added the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fall that we shall make use of!&rdquo; replied Cyrus. &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was
      such that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how was
      this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect
      instruments? Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above
      their strength?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert and
      Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woodmen have just finished, captain.&rdquo; said the sailor, laughing, &ldquo;and
      when you want masons&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masons,&mdash;no, but chemists,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the reporter, &ldquo;we are going to blow up the island&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow up the island?&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of it, at least,&rdquo; replied Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer. And he made known to them
      the result of his observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in the
      mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended to
      penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through which the water rushed
      must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger outlet.
      Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which would make a
      deep trench in some other part of the shore. This was what Harding was
      going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft,
      received this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a
      cascade, that suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist as
      a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would be all
      that they liked, &ldquo;even a professor of dancing and deportment,&rdquo; said he to
      Neb, if that was ever necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the
      dugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect
      confidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly, without
      even asking a question. A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding, Herbert,
      and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein of coals,
      where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the most recent
      transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a specimen. All
      the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these stones to the
      Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations. These
      shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint, alumina, and
      sulphuret of iron&mdash;the latter in excess&mdash;it was necessary to
      separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as rapidly
      as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could then be
      extracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents
      the most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a nation
      can be measured by the consumption which is made of it. This acid would
      later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of candles,
      tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for another
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground was
      perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped
      wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites, buttressed one
      against the other, the whole being covered with a thin layer of pyrites,
      previously reduced to the size of a nut.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the
      shist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new
      layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap, the
      exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several air-holes
      being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to
      make charcoal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would not
      take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed
      to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina, two equally
      soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with other
      operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,&mdash;it was
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it in
      large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine from
      the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to be
      treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one or other of these
      substances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by separating
      the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the engineer wished to
      obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment by lime would give
      calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless, while treatment by
      soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap, which could be put to
      domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather try
      to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for marine plants abounded on the
      shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form wrack. A
      large quantity of these plants was collected, first dried, then burnt in
      holes in the open air. The combustion of these plants was kept up for
      several days, and the result was a compact gray mass, which has been long
      known under the name of &ldquo;natural soda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a
      soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future
      preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known
      under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the
      carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of
      the vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would
      have been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the
      saltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it
      up. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had
      nothing to do but purify this salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      These different works lasted a week. They were finished before the
      transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been
      accomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to construct
      a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for the
      distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained. All this
      was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the chemical
      transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft,
      skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever workmen.
      Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and who teaches
      the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result of
      the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina, flint,
      remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water. They
      stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained a
      clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of
      alumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble.
      Lastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of iron
      were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the
      sulphate of alumina, was thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate
      of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The
      making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable
      works are necessary&mdash;a special set of tools, an apparatus of platina,
      leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the transformation
      is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these at his disposal, but he
      knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured by very
      simple means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior
      degree of concentration. It is thus that the acid known under the name of
      Nordhausen acid is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make, to
      calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the
      sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation, would
      produce the acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would
      distil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and
      on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer was the
      possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many different
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid; and
      that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives azotic,
      or nitric, acid by distillation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His
      companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of
      the result at which he aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a last
      operation he would procure the substance which had given so much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been
      previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and
      he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints
      of an oily yellow mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at a
      distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion, and
      when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented
      himself with saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is nitro-glycerine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is
      perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so
      many accidents. However, since a way has been found to transform it into
      dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or
      sugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used with
      some security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the
      settlers worked on Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?&rdquo; said Pencroft
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and this nitro-glycerine will
      produce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and
      will oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when shall we see this, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the
      engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point
      which formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred
      feet from the coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from
      the waters, which were only restrained by their granite case. Therefore,
      if this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form a
      stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau, would
      rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the lake would be greatly
      lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be exposed, which
      was their final aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the engineer&rsquo;s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which he
      handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was made
      on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a much lower
      level than that of the water of the lake. In this way the explosive force,
      by scattering the rock, would open a large place for the water to rush
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great
      effect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine
      to the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that towards
      four o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the mine was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised.
      Generally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in
      bursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce the
      explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without
      exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In default
      of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to guncotton,
      since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This substance, pressed in a
      cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would burst by means
      of a fuse, and cause the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock. He
      resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not
      succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread
      out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the operator
      could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim to the
      operation. Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of iron,
      weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just above the
      mine. Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur, was
      attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay on
      the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being set
      on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching fire in
      its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the
      nitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after
      having sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the
      nitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few drops
      of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was already
      suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the
      place, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact, five
      and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was heard. The
      island appeared to tremble to its very foundation. Stones were projected
      in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano. The shock produced by the
      displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the Chimneys shook. The
      settlers, although they were more than two miles from the mine, were
      thrown on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank
      of the lake must have been shattered by the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid stream
      of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a height of
      three hundred feet on to the beach!

    <h2>
      Chapter 18
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual habit
      he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he remained
      motionless. Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy, Pencroft
      nodded his great head, murmuring these words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, our engineer gets on capitally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it had
      made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through this new
      outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the old one.
      The result was, that a short time after the operation the level of the
      lake would be lowered two feet, or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped
      spears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to the
      plateau, Top accompanying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you have
      made, one could blow up the whole of our island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,&rdquo; replied
      the engineer. &ldquo;It is only a question of quantity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?&rdquo; asked
      the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy
      to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid,
      saltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have not
      got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;with a little determination&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft had erased the word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; from the dictionary of Lincoln
      Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately towards
      that point of the lake near which was the old opening now uncovered. This
      outlet had now become practicable, since the water no longer rushed
      through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake, and
      a glance showed them that the object had been attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the water,
      appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare by the
      retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice was nearly
      twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like the mouth of
      a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy
      passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon
      made it of a suitable height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening, in
      its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to
      thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that the
      declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the level
      of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in the
      interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain, what are we stopping for?&rdquo; asked the sailor, impatient to
      enter the narrow passage. &ldquo;You see Top has got before us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;But we must see our way. Neb, go and
      cut some resinous branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other
      green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made into
      torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus Harding
      leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the overplus
      of the lake had formerly filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage
      increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able to
      stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time, was
      very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were all
      attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending
      mountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular steps,
      made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the rocks, shone
      here and there under the light of the torches, and the explorers guessed
      that the sides were clothed with innumerable stalactites. The engineer
      examined this black granite. There was not a stratum, not a break in it.
      The mass was compact, and of an extremely close grain. The passage dated,
      then, from the very origin of the island. It was not the water which
      little by little had hollowed it. Pluto and not Neptune had bored it with
      his own hand, and on the wall traces of an eruptive work could be
      distinguished, which all the washing of the water had not been able
      totally to efface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain awe,
      in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time visited by
      human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and the thought came
      to more than one, that some polypus or other gigantic cephalopod might
      inhabit the interior cavities, which were in communication with the sea.
      However, Top kept at the head of the little band, and they could rely on
      the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail to give the alarm if there was
      any need for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road,
      Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up
      with him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a
      cavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of water fell from the vault, but
      that did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply the
      last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through this
      cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but producing no
      mephitic exhalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Cyrus,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;here is a very secure
      retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however,
      uninhabitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why uninhabitable?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is too small and too dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light and
      air?&rdquo; replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on with our exploration,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;Perhaps lower
      down, nature will have spared us this labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have only gone a third of the way,&rdquo; observed Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly a third,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;for we have descended a hundred feet
      from the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther
      down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Top?&rdquo; asked Neb, interrupting his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most likely he has gone on,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us join him,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the
      deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he could
      easily have given an account of its general direction, which went towards
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was
      attracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped
      and listened. These sounds, carried through the passage as through an
      acoustic tube, came clearly to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Top barking!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and our brave dog is barking furiously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have our iron-tipped spears,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;Keep on your guard,
      and forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is becoming more and more interesting,&rdquo; murmured Gideon Spilett in the
      sailor&rsquo;s ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the help of
      their dog. Top&rsquo;s barking became more and more perceptible, and it seemed
      strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose
      retreat he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger to which they
      might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an irresistible
      curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and
      Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and at the
      same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears raised, were
      ready for any emergency which might arise. The enormous cavern was empty.
      The settlers explored it in every direction. There was nothing there, not
      an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued to bark. Neither
      caresses nor threats could make him be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake reached
      the sea,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and we must take care not to tumble into a
      hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Top, go!&rdquo; cried Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, excited by his master&rsquo;s words, ran towards the extremity of the
      cavern, and there redoubled his barking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth of
      a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped; and
      this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a
      perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding
      took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin,
      whose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its fall,
      lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The flame
      then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached the
      water, that is to say, the level of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to
      calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the level
      of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is our dwelling,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was occupied by some creature,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, whose
      curiosity was not yet satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this
      opening,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and has left the place for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; added the sailor, &ldquo;I should like very much to be Top just
      for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn&rsquo;t bark for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were near
      him might have heard him murmur these words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied.
      Chance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them
      great service. They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size of
      which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their
      torches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by means
      of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as a
      spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return. The
      place was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this
      excavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of
      rendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think of
      lighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite
      which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea might
      be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly calculated its
      obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage, and was therefore
      led to believe that the outer wall could not be very thick. If light was
      thus obtained, so would a means of access, for it would be as easy to
      pierce a door as windows, and to establish an exterior ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding made known his ideas to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, captain, let us set to work!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;I have my pickaxe,
      and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable
      recess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the
      torches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then
      Spilett took Neb&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot
      the wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by
      Gideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall only measured there three feet in thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground from
      a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea-coast, the islet,
      and beyond the open sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and
      producing a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than
      thirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and
      its vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the
      vaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral
      piers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing
      themselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses could
      be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections formed
      like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque mixture of all the
      styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced by the
      hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone had
      hollowed this fairy Alhambra in a mass of granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only
      expected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous
      palace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported into
      a temple!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the
      echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my friends!&rdquo; exclaimed Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;when we have lighted the
      interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in the
      left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will make
      our study and our museum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will call it?&mdash;&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granite House,&rdquo; replied Harding; a name which his companions again
      saluted with a cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return
      by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put
      off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well, which
      descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened
      attentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the
      undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths. A flaming
      branch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were lighted up for an
      instant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the
      water, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean
      passage, before the new opening had been offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the
      gulf, without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, &ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, my friend?&rdquo; asked the engineer, as if he had returned
      from the land of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The torches will soon go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark
      passage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The
      ascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the upper
      grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long granite
      staircase. Then they began to climb again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no
      longer sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The
      one which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their way
      in the dark, they must hasten.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done, and a little before four o&rsquo;clock, at the moment when the
      sailor&rsquo;s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions
      passed out of the passage.

    <h2>
      Chapter 19
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling was
      commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient
      shelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst
      of solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky. Their
      former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for the
      engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works. Cyrus
      Harding&rsquo;s first care was to find out the position of the front of Granite
      House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the pickaxe when it
      escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly to
      the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be sufficient to show the
      place where the hole had been pierced in the granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a
      perpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some
      rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they
      evidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for
      them. It was the engineer&rsquo;s intention to divide the right portion of the
      cavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light
      it by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft was
      much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the use of
      the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through which it
      would always be easy to enter Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;if it is easy for us to reach our dwelling
      by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides us. I mean, on
      the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it hermetically, and, if
      it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance by making a dam, and thus
      causing the water of the lake to rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how shall we get in?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By an outside ladder,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;a rope ladder, which, once
      drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why so many precautions?&rdquo; asked Pencroft. &ldquo;As yet we have seen no
      dangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don&rsquo;t
      believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?&rdquo; asked the engineer, looking at the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every
      direction,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harding, &ldquo;for we know only a small portion of it as yet. But
      at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from the
      exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be provided
      against every contingency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection,
      Pencroft prepared to execute his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a
      door, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would
      admit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be
      their chief room. This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above
      the ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with
      its first rays. It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which
      was between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular
      line traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus the
      winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was
      protected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were made,
      the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would
      prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be concealed in
      need.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long
      with the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious man.
      He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he
      employed it usefully. By means of this explosive substance the rock was
      broken open at the very places chosen by the engineer. Then, with the
      pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the jagged
      edges were smoothed off, and a few days after the beginning of the work,
      Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun, whose rays
      penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the plan proposed by
      Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five compartments looking
      out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a door, which would meet the
      ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a dining-room, measuring forty
      feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and lastly, a &ldquo;Visitor&rsquo;s room,&rdquo;
       petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was next to the great hall. These
      rooms, or rather this suite of rooms, would not occupy all the depth of
      the cave. There would be also a corridor and a storehouse, in which their
      tools, provisions, and stores would be kept. All the productions of the
      island, the flora as well as the fauna, were to be there in the best
      possible state of preservation, and completely sheltered from the damp.
      There was no want of space, so that each object could be methodically
      arranged. Besides, the colonists had still at their disposal the little
      grotto above the great cavern, which was like the garret of the new
      dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners became
      brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of Granite
      House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered the cavern
      by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them first to
      climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river&rsquo;s bank, and then to
      descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to climb as far when
      they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great loss of time, and
      was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore, resolved to proceed
      without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder,
      which, once raised, would render Granite House completely inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed
      of the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick
      cable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with
      light, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly
      hand of Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a
      tackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be raised
      into Granite House. The transport of the materials being thus simplified,
      the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately. There was no want
      of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there ready to be used. The
      framework of the partitions was soon raised, very roughly at first, and in
      a short time, the cave was divided into rooms and storehouses, according
      to the plan agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the
      engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came
      amiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and
      zealous companions. They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft
      always having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes
      rope-maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to all
      the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer was complete;
      nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of undertaking anything
      and succeeding in everything. The question of boots and clothes&mdash;assuredly
      a serious question,&mdash;that of light during the winter months,
      utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming the wild flora
      into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus Harding helping,
      everything would be done in time. He dreamed of canals facilitating the
      transport of the riches of the ground; workings of quarries and mines;
      machines for every industrial manufacture; railroads; yes, railroads! of
      which a network would certainly one day cover Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of
      this brave heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled
      to hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future which
      he felt. In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course of
      vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them. It was
      on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend, for the
      distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that to hazard
      themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction, would be a
      serious and perilous thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; as the sailor said, &ldquo;they quite took the wind out of the sails of
      the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an
      indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and
      active; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding became
      more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and reverent love
      for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close sympathy which existed between
      the two, but he was not in the least jealous. Neb was Neb: he was what he
      would be always, courage, zeal, devotion, self-denial personified. He had
      the same faith in his master that Pencroft had, but he showed it less
      vehemently. When the sailor was enthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he
      would say, &ldquo;Nothing could be more natural.&rdquo; Pencroft and he were great
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less
      skilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished the
      sailor. A &ldquo;journalist,&rdquo; clever, not only in understanding, but in
      performing everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less than
      a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet. Harding had
      been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting by an
      overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above the
      ground. This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a sort of
      platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the oscillation
      was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be raised to the
      level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was secured both at
      its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at its upper end,
      which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had been made much
      easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish an hydraulic
      apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time, for the
      inhabitants of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were
      light and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up the
      masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But it was also
      necessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his four paws, was not
      formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft was such a zealous master,
      that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon mounted the
      ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not be said that
      the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once Pencroft
      hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively
      conducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question was
      not neglected. Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been voted
      purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase. As yet, they
      only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for want
      of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the immense
      woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been given,
      were not explored. They reserved this important excursion for the first
      fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game; kangaroos
      and boars abounded, and the hunters&rsquo; iron-tipped spears and bows and arrows
      did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the southwest point of
      the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow, covered with willows
      and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such as thyme, basil, savory,
      all the sweet-scented species of the labiated plants, which the rabbits
      appeared to be particularly fond of.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the rabbits,
      it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting, the two
      sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any rate, it produced an
      abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had a good
      opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom. Herbert
      gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony, etc., which
      possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral, astringent,
      febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When, afterwards,
      Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For medicine,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;to treat us when we are ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?&rdquo; asked
      Pencroft quite seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his
      collection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House.
      Besides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America as
      &ldquo;Oswego tea,&rdquo; which made an excellent beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site of
      the warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the burrows!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;so I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are they inhabited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals,
      similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that even
      Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these rodents
      escaped them easily. But the reporter resolved not to leave the place,
      until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds. He wished
      to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they might take
      later. It would not have been difficult to do this, with a few snares
      stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at this moment they had
      neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must, therefore, be
      satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it with a stick,
      hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes. They
      were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by the
      name of American rabbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured
      at the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be
      despised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the
      colony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only to
      be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A chimney
      was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen. The pipe
      destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to these amateur
      bricklayers. It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of brick clay; as
      creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to be thought of, a
      hole was pierced in the granite above the window of the kitchen, and the
      pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps the winds which blew
      directly against the facade would make the chimney smoke, but these winds
      were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was not so very particular
      about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied
      himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any access
      by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly
      cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan of drowning
      this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring them to their
      former level by means of a dam. He contented himself with hiding the
      obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the interstices
      of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly. However, he used
      the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh water to the new
      dwelling. A little trench, made below their level, produced this result;
      and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible source yielded
      twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be any want of
      water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and it was time, for the
      bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the windows of the facade,
      until the engineer had time to make glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections
      around the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming
      grass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which had
      a pleasing effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not but
      be charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over a
      boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the
      north, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union Bay was spread before them.
      Yes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was
      lavish in his praise of what he humorously called, &ldquo;his apartments on the
      fifth floor above the ground!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 20
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with
      the month of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers
      and squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission. The tenants
      of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling which
      sheltered them from the inclement weather. The Chimneys would have been
      quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and it was
      to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption. Cyrus
      Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as to preserve
      as much as possible the forge and furnace which were established there.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different
      occupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder being,
      therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had leisure,
      proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great results. He soon
      made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the warren henceforth
      every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb employed nearly all his time
      in salting or smoking meat, which insured their always having plenty of
      provisions. The question of clothes was now seriously discussed, the
      settlers having no other garments than those they wore when the balloon
      threw them on the island. These clothes were warm and good; they had taken
      great care of them as well as of their linen, and they were perfectly
      whole, but they would soon need to be replaced. Moreover, if the winter
      was severe, the settlers would suffer greatly from cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide
      for their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a store
      of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question of clothes
      had been settled. They must therefore make up their minds to pass this
      first winter without additional clothing. When the fine season came round
      again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been seen on the
      expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected, the engineer
      would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How? He would
      consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
      &ldquo;There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;Lincoln Island is not situated under a
      very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did you
      not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that of
      Spain in the other hemisphere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but some winters in Spain are very
      cold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as
      rigorously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that the
      temperature will be more moderate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, captain?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in
      which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores
      this heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium
      temperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall prove that,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to bother
      myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that is
      that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we talk
      about the question of light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk about?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when shall we begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, by having a seal hunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make candles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the engineer&rsquo;s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had
      lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish
      the fat necessary for the manufacture.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to
      observe this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered to
      Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in Lincoln
      Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the islet. They
      asked for nothing more&mdash;they gave thanks. The next day, the 5th of
      June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet. They had to
      profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was agreed that they
      would construct, for this purpose, as well as they could, a boat which
      would render communication so much easier, and would also permit them to
      ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest
      of the island, which was put off till the first fine days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped
      spears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and
      only brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being
      intended for the manufacture of boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all
      to be employed in the fabrication of candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely
      perfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would only
      have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid with the
      neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from this new
      combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and the stearin,
      by employing boiling water. But to simplify the operation, he preferred to
      saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a calcareous soap,
      easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime into the
      state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being
      liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others,
      they formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks,
      after several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the
      liquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the
      hand, which only wanted whiteness and polish. They would not doubtless
      have the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic acid,
      and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but Cyrus
      Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these candles
      would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new
      dwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which
      were very rough, and added others also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last able
      to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their beards.
      Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were bristling in a
      way which justified the making of the said scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an
      instrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the
      ligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards, to
      furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding
      consisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which
      rested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb
      worked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist&rsquo;s laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the
      waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two
      bridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now
      the plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse,
      which had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island. To avoid
      it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour, by
      climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was to
      establish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to
      five and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter&rsquo;s work that was needed
      was to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some
      days. Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited by
      them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the downs.
      They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the former
      inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters, which
      soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of the Mercy.
      These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists consumed some
      daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as yet
      only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost all
      their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into its most secret
      recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile Point, they
      would find new treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no want
      of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which they had
      found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink, which was
      preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes or
      beet-roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the &ldquo;acer
      saceharinum,&rdquo; a sort of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate
      zones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made a very
      agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren; lastly, they
      had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in food... but
      bread was wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent,
      it was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree among
      the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these precious
      trees. However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an infinitesimal
      proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his intelligence, all
      his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce that which, by the
      greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining of his waistcoat,
      which he was occupied in setting to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled in
      the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at once,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, captain&mdash;A grain of corn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he showed his companions a grain&mdash;a single grain&mdash;which from
      a hole in his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when at
      Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grain of corn?&rdquo; said the engineer quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain; but one, only one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; said Pencroft, laughing, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting on capitally, upon
      my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make bread of it,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bread, cakes, tarts!&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;Come, the bread that this
      grain of corn will make won&rsquo;t choke us very soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to
      throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it, found
      that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the face&mdash;&ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo;
       he asked quietly, &ldquo;do you know how many ears one grain of corn can
      produce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, I suppose!&rdquo; replied the sailor, surprised at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, upon my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About eighty!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;Then, if we plant this grain, at the
      first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second will
      produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred and
      twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of
      millions! There is the proportion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding&rsquo;s companions listened without answering. These numbers astonished
      them. They were exact, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friends,&rdquo; continued the engineer, &ldquo;such are the arithmetical
      progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication of
      the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains,
      compared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to the
      tobacco-plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In a few
      years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests their
      fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the engineer had not finished his lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Pencroft,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;do you know how many bushels four
      hundred thousand millions of grains would make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;but what I do know is, that I am nothing better
      than a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty
      thousand a bushel, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three millions!&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In four years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In four years,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and even in two years, if, as I
      hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply otherwise
      than by a tremendous hurrah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Herbert,&rdquo; added the engineer, &ldquo;you have made a discovery of great
      importance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the
      condition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain, no, we shan&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;and if ever I
      find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and sixty
      thousand, I assure you I won&rsquo;t throw it away! And now, what must we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must plant this grain,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and with every possible care, for it bears
      in itself our future harvests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided it grows!&rdquo; cried the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will grow,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this
      single precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in a pot,
      but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and confide it
      to the earth. This was done that very day, and it is needless to add, that
      every precaution was taken that the experiment might succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above Granite
      House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered from the
      wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun. The place was
      cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms; then a bed
      of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was surrounded by
      a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some
      edifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only
      match, and all the anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing was
      more serious. In fact, the castaways would have been always able to
      procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply
      another grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!

    <p>
      From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to
      visit what he gravely called his &ldquo;corn-field.&rdquo; And woe to the insects
      which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather
      became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer would
      certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is
      considerably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June, the
      day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year, was a
      Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but Pencroft
      replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one, which was
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the mouth
      of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was
      frozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood.
      Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had
      brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was an
      indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the floating
      wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel which was so
      abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several cartloads of coal,
      which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin. The
      powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in the low temperature,
      which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that is,
      thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had been established in
      the dining-room, where they all worked together at their different
      avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding had great cause to
      congratulate himself on having brought to Granite House the little stream
      of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen surface, and conducted
      through the passage, it preserved its fluidity, and arrived at an interior
      reservoir which had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom,
      while the overflow ran through the well to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed
      as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that
      part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide extent
      of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for water-birds
      ought to swarm there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there, and
      as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied. As an
      unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole colony took
      part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett,
      Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and arrows,
      and provided with provisions, left Granite House, preceded by Top, who
      bounded before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; as the engineer justly observed, &ldquo;that could not take the place of
      a regular bridge!&rdquo; So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted in
      the list of future works.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank of
      the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb
      coniferae now sprinkled over with snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of
      quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth into
      the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I should say those are foxes!&rdquo; cried Herbert, when he saw the troop
      rapidly decamping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of barking,
      at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped short in
      the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History.
      But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails
      terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert was
      able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of &ldquo;Arctic foxes.&rdquo;
       They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all
      parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels.
      Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch one of these
      carnivora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they good to eat?&rdquo; asked Pencroft, who only regarded the
      representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Herbert; &ldquo;but zoologists have not yet found out if the eye
      of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to class
      them in the genus dog, properly so called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad&rsquo;s reflection, which
      showed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he found
      that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were nothing to
      him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite House, he
      observed that it would be best to take some precautions against a probable
      visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one disputed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by the
      open sea. It was then eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The sky was very
      clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk,
      neither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere
      too severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more bearable.
      A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just issuing from
      the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a Mediterranean
      gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form of a yataghan,
      tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To the left the edge of
      the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point. Certainly, in this part of
      Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open sea, not even a sandbank,
      ships beaten by the east winds would have found no shelter. They perceived
      by the tranquillity of the sea, in which no shallows troubled the waters,
      by its uniform color, which was stained by no yellow shades, by the
      absence of even a reef, that the coast was steep and that the ocean there
      covered a deep abyss. Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles,
      rose the first trees of the forests of the Far West. They might have
      believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in the
      Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded. The colonists halted at this
      place for breakfast. A fire of brushwood and dried seaweed was lighted,
      and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat, to which he added some cups
      of Oswego tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was very
      sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter was thus
      led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the shore, they
      would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,&rdquo; replied the
      engineer, &ldquo;for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we could
      have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were sandbanks,
      an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here, nothing but the
      depths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is singular enough,&rdquo; remarked Spilett, &ldquo;that this comparatively small
      island should present such varied ground. This diversity of aspect,
      logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One would really
      say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is
      washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to
      the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear Spilett,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;I have also
      observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this island
      strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents,
      and I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;Why should not Australia, New Ireland,
      Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have once formed
      a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia, as Africa or
      the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all these islands,
      emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of a continent, now
      submerged, but which was above the waters at a prehistoric period.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the Atlantis was formerly,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?&rdquo; asked
      Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probable,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and that would sufficiently,
      explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the great number of animals which still inhabit it,&rdquo; added Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and you furnish me with an argument
      to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen, that animals
      are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that the species
      are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to me it is that
      Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast continent which
      had gradually sunk below the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, some fine day,&rdquo; said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely
      convinced, &ldquo;the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn,
      and there will be nothing between America and Asia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;there will be new continents which millions and
      millions of animalculae are building at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are these masons?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coral insects,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;By constant work they made the
      island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the
      Pacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh a
      grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of water
      which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and this
      limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness and
      solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature
      employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these
      microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which the
      dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently diminished&mdash;which
      is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of the earth, now
      actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding to centuries,
      and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be changed into a vast
      continent, which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will take a long time,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature has time for it,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would be the use of new continents?&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;It appears
      to me that the present extent of habitable countries is sufficient for
      humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing uselessly, certainly,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but this is how the
      necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the tropical
      zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least to me this
      explanation appears plausible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are listening, captain,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe
      will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be
      possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected. What
      they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think that it
      will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the sun will
      experience after millions of years; others, from the gradual extinction of
      the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a greater influence on
      it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last hypothesis, grounding
      it on the fact that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer
      habitable, although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same
      amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the
      interior fires to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world, it owes
      its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly, whatever may be the cause, our
      globe will become cold some day, but this cold will only operate
      gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate zones, at a more or less
      distant period, will not be more habitable than the polar regions now are.
      Then the population of men, as well as the animals, will flow towards the
      latitudes which are more directly under the solar influence. An immense
      emigration will take place. Europe, Central Asia, North America, will
      gradually be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of
      South America. The vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora
      will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna. The
      central parts of South America and Africa will be the continents chiefly
      inhabited. The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the climate of the
      polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean. Who can say, that at
      this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small, to contain and
      nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may not provident nature, so as to give
      refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying
      the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have
      entrusted these insects with the construction of it? I have often thought
      of all these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect
      of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of
      new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages, a
      Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas,
      or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia, and Europe. Then
      these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will
      die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life
      will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period.
      Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest&mdash;will be left to death&mdash;to
      revive some day under superior conditions! But all that, my friends, is
      the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning by the work of the
      insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried too far, in investigating
      the secrets of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cyrus,&rdquo; replied Spilett, &ldquo;these theories are prophecies to me,
      and they will be accomplished some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the secret of God,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is well and good,&rdquo; then said Pencroft, who had listened with all
      his might, &ldquo;but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has been made
      by your insects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Harding; &ldquo;it is of a purely volcanic origin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will disappear some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t be here then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no
      wish to die here, and hope to get away some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;let us establish ourselves
      here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was
      continued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy region. It
      was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which terminated the
      island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles. The soil was
      formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable matter, such as the
      remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there beds of grass, thick
      as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools sparkled in the sun.
      Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling, could supply
      these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded that the marsh was fed by
      the infiltrations of the soil and it was really so. It was also to be
      feared that during the heat miasmas would arise, which might produce
      fevers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water, fluttered
      numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in flocks, and those
      fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the
      birds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged
      to content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the
      silent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the
      noise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh. The
      hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had white
      bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white, and red,
      and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in the capture
      of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of the island.
      The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game. At some future
      time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was probable that
      some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least brought to the
      shores of the lake, so that they would be more within their reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      About five o&rsquo;clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions
      retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn&rsquo;s Fens, and
      crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.

      Chapter 22
    </h2>
    <p>
      This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however,
      passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere
      was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew,
      the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely. Pencroft
      regretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of bears
      rather than of so many foxes and seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bears,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are generally very well dressed, and I ask no more than
      to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied Neb, laughing, &ldquo;perhaps the bears would not consent to give
      you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, in
      quite an authoritative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any rate
      they had not yet shown themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied themselves
      with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful
      prize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares
      would be well received at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground, a
      platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and at
      the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It must be
      mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but at certain
      places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds frequented the
      ground. They were visited every day, and at three different times, during
      the first days, specimens of those Antarctic foxes which they had already
      seen on the right bank of the Mercy were found in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, when
      for the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at
      it in great disgust, he added, &ldquo;beasts which are good for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;they are good for something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make bait to attract other creatures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the
      foxes carcasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain
      plant, and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day
      passed without some rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always
      rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not think
      of complaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied
      the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several of
      those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of the
      lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable. He could
      see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these are not pigs,&rdquo; said Herbert to him, &ldquo;I warn you of that,
      Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one of
      these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage which
      served it as a tail. &ldquo;Let me believe that these are pigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that pleases me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very fond of pig,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;particularly of its feet,
      and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of the
      four species which are included in the family, and they were also of the
      species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence of
      those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed. These
      peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they abounded
      in the woody parts of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not ask
      more from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly
      moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose some
      degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in resolving
      into snow. All the island was covered with a sheet of white, and showed
      itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect. The snow fell abundantly for
      several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite House
      the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some places, the
      wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall whirling
      columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their base, and
      which vessels attack with a shot from a gun. However, the storm, coming
      from the northwest, blew across the island, and the position of Granite
      House preserved it from a direct attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been
      produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions
      could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they remained
      shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August. They could
      hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely suffer from
      it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the roots, but Pencroft
      consoled himself by thinking that he would not have the trouble of cutting
      them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is turning woodman, let it alone,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for
      having prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding
      had also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature who
      had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it. There
      all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them. If they had
      constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights, it certainly
      would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to the Chimneys, it
      must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea, passing over the
      islet, would beat furiously against it. But here, in Granite House, in the
      middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea nor air had any
      influence, there was nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and
      little by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the most
      solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and Pencroft
      were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they would not have
      changed on any account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly
      in this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the
      north, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number of
      purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut down
      these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now be
      effectively employed. The first attempts were somewhat crude, but in
      consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen, by
      consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by emulating
      each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by several
      baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with them, and in
      special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes, stone-pine almonds,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again.
      The temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists
      sallied out directly. There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore,
      but they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened
      surface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the
      part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform
      color. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore, the
      forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters of the Mercy flowed
      under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the tide, broke
      up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over the frozen surface of
      the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were assembled in
      thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were bristling with
      icicles. One might have said that the water escaped by a monstrous
      gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the Renaissance.
      As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that could not as yet
      be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy covering was
      dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of
      going to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the snow
      with which they were covered. They had also to be careful not to fall into
      one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and
      humiliating; to be taken in their own snares! But happily they avoided
      this unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact. No animal had
      fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were very
      numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert did not
      hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had passed
      there, which justified the engineer&rsquo;s opinion that dangerous beasts
      existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally lived in the
      forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had ventured as far
      as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out the inhabitants of
      Granite House. &ldquo;Now, what are these feline creatures?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
      &ldquo;They are tigers,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;I thought those beasts were only
      found in hot countries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the new continent,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;they are found from Mexico to
      the Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the
      same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that
      tigers are to be met with in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must look out for them,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the influence
      of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white soon
      vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed their
      stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup from the
      maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren, agouties, and
      kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several excursions into
      the forest, and they found that a great number of trees had been blown
      down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the cart as
      far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel. They saw
      in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely damaged by the wind, at
      least six feet of it having been blown off.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite
      House, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become
      free, to float down several rafts. They could see that the cold period was
      not ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but
      congratulate themselves on not having been living there during the
      hurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages. Sweeping
      over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half filling them
      with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks. While Neb,
      Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding and Gideon
      Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights, and they
      found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as they had been
      from the first by the heaps of sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done
      with the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the
      month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of the
      temperature. It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end of the
      month of August, which is the February of North America, does not escape
      this climatic law.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted
      to the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According to
      the engineer&rsquo;s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit
      thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero, and
      this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale, lasted for
      several days. The colonists were again shut up in Granite House, and as it
      was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings of the facade, only
      leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the consumption of candles
      was considerable. To economize them, the cavern was often only lighted by
      the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not spared. Several times, one or
      other of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the
      waves heaped up at each tide, but they soon climbed up again to Granite
      House, and it was not without pain and difficulty that their hands could
      hold to the rounds of the ladder. In consequence of the intense cold,
      their fingers felt as if burned when they touched the rounds. To occupy
      the leisure hours, which the tenants of Granite House now had at their
      disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an operation which could be performed
      indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than the
      liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep incisions
      in the tree. They contented themselves with collecting this liquor in jars
      and employing it in this state for different culinary purposes, and the
      more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to become white and to be of
      a syrupy consistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus Harding
      announced that they were going to turn into refiners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refiners!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;That is rather a warm trade, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very warm,&rdquo; answered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will be seasonable!&rdquo; said the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate
      manufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this
      liquor, only an extremely easy operation is required. Placed on the fire
      in large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and soon a
      scum arose to its surface. As soon as this began to thicken, Neb carefully
      removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the evaporation, and at
      the same time prevented it from contracting an empyreumatic flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to
      the operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed
      into a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously
      fabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various
      shapes. The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes and
      tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly transparent
      and of a delicious taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in
      Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every
      day they attempted sorties which they could not prolong. They constantly
      worked at the improvement of their dwelling. They talked while working.
      Harding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining
      to them the practical applications of science. The colonists had no
      library at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always at
      hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered all
      their questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus passed away
      pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears for the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the
      cessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a
      way to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to
      the downs or to Tadorn&rsquo;s Fens! Game would have been easily approached, and
      the chase would certainly have been most productive. But Cyrus Harding
      considered it of importance that no one should injure his health, for he
      had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this
      imprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found
      Granite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from one room to
      another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut up. Harding
      often remarked that when he approached the dark well which communicated
      with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back of the
      storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round this
      hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he tried to
      put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it. He then yelped in
      a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer observed this maneuver several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the
      intelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could
      narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island? Did
      some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom of
      this well? The engineer did not know what to think, and could not refrain
      from dreaming of many strange improbabilities. Accustomed to go far into
      the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow himself to be drawn
      into the regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural; but yet
      how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs who never waste their
      time in barking at the moon, should persist in trying with scent and
      hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing there to cause his
      uneasiness? Top&rsquo;s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even more than he cared to
      acknowledge to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon
      Spilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the
      suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top&rsquo;s fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow,
      hailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice
      melted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of the
      Mercy, the forest, again became practicable. This return of spring
      delighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed in it
      the hours necessary for eating and sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to
      again entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by
      Cyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it
      would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be of
      any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future time,
      observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had become very
      skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals, agouties,
      kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes, in short,
      game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows, and that,
      consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would listen to
      nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till he promised
      to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however, supported Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, which may be doubted,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the island is inhabited by wild
      beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may
      come when this will be our first duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied
      Harding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed
      this winter, but they would not last until next winter. Skins of carnivora
      or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and since there
      were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the means of forming a
      flock which might be brought up for the use of the colony. An enclosure
      for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the birds, in a word to
      establish a sort of farm in the island, such were the two important
      projects for the fine season.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became of
      much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts
      of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which
      extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity
      of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western side.
      But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this
      exploration could be profitably undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred
      which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their
      domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his
      traps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found three
      animals which would be very welcome for the larder. They were a female
      peccary and her two young ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture, and,
      as usual, he made a great show of his game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And you too,
      Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; replied the reporter; &ldquo;but what is it that I am
      going to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suckling-pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you were
      bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you turn up your nose at
      suckling-pig?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; &ldquo;provided
      one doesn&rsquo;t eat too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; returned the sailor, who was not pleased
      whenever he heard his chase made light of. &ldquo;You like to make objections.
      Seven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only
      too glad to have met with such game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;man is never perfect, nor contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;I hope that Neb will distinguish himself. Look
      here! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old! They
      will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look after the
      cooking myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were soon
      absorbed in their culinary labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared a
      magnificent repast&mdash;the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked
      ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they had,
      but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House. The
      kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving
      himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring his
      share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!&rdquo; replied the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which
      had cost him a grinder&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a pebble&mdash;it was a leaden bullet.

      Chapter 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown
      on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the researches they
      had made, no human being had been discovered. No smoke even had betrayed
      the presence of man on the surface of the island. No vestiges of his
      handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late period had man lived
      there. Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited by any but themselves,
      but the colonists were compelled to believe that it never had been
      inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell before a
      simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent! In fact,
      this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being
      could have used such a weapon?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked at
      it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result from
      this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance, immediately
      took possession of their minds. The sudden apparition of a supernatural
      being could not have startled them more completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions which
      this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to raise in
      his mind. He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled it between
      his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than
      three months old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more, captain,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;It was still sucking its mother
      when I found it in the trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;that proves that within three months a
      gun-shot was fired in Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that a bullet,&rdquo; added Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;wounded, though not mortally,
      this little animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is unquestionable,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and these are the
      deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was
      inhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three
      months. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by
      disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked? This point can only be
      cleared up later. As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or
      friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit
      the island, or if they have left it, we know not. But these questions are
      of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!&rdquo; cried the sailor, springing
      up from the table. &ldquo;There are no other men than ourselves on Lincoln
      Island! By my faith! The island isn&rsquo;t large and if it had been inhabited,
      we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be much more astonishing, I should think,&rdquo; observed the
      reporter, &ldquo;if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Neb seriously, &ldquo;if Pencroft has not had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Neb,&rdquo; burst out Pencroft. &ldquo;Do you think I could have a bullet
      in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out? Where could it be
      hidden?&rdquo; he asked, opening his mouth to show the two-and-thirty teeth with
      which it was furnished. &ldquo;Look well, Neb, and if you find one hollow tooth
      in this set, I will let you pull out half a dozen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb&rsquo;s supposition is certainly inadmissible,&rdquo; replied Harding, who,
      notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.
      &ldquo;It is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three
      months at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed on
      this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just touched
      here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of Mount
      Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we should
      have been seen ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within only a few
      weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of the coast.
      However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this point
      settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we should act with caution,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is my advice,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;for it is to be feared that
      Malay pirates have landed on the island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; asked the sailor, &ldquo;would it not be a good plan, before setting
      out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the river, or, if we
      liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be unprovided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your idea is good, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;but we cannot wait
      for that. It would take at least a month to build a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a real boat,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;but we do not want one for a sea
      voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct a
      canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five days,&rdquo; cried Neb, &ldquo;to build a boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of wood?&rdquo; asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of wood,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;or rather of bark. I repeat, captain, that
      in five days the work will be finished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In five days, then, be it,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But till that time we must be very watchful,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very watchful indeed, my friends,&rdquo; replied Harding; &ldquo;and I beg you to
      confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the
      settlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was hereafter
      an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but cause great
      uneasiness among the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about
      the matter. They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not
      have some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had
      been saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them at
      different times. However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the pros
      and cons of the question, ended by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cyrus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall
      find nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with
      boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be well
      suited for navigating the Mercy&mdash;above all, for approaching its
      source, where the water would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark,
      fastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of natural
      obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be easily
      carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means of nails,
      to insure the canoe being water-tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong and
      supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a number of
      large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited for their
      purpose. Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had only to be
      barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to the imperfect
      tools which the settlers possessed. However, they overcame all
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself without
      losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but admire
      the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and spear.
      Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which
      may justly be called &ldquo;the reasoning of bravery.&rdquo; These two companions of
      the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s recommendations, did not go beyond
      a radius of two miles round Granite House; but the borders of the forest
      furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos,
      peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps was less than during the
      cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota, which might have fed
      all the colony in Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the
      incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from
      it, and one day&mdash;it was the 26th of October&mdash;he said&mdash;&ldquo;But,
      Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways
      have landed on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite
      House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very astonishing if they are still here,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;but not
      astonishing at all if they are here no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think that these people have already quitted the island?&rdquo; returned
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and
      above all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last
      betrayed their presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they were able to go away,&rdquo; observed the lad, &ldquo;they could not have
      been castaways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional
      castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the
      island without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they
      went away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must acknowledge one thing,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;it is that Captain Harding
      appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings on our
      island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; responded the reporter, &ldquo;there are only Malays who frequent
      these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;that some day or other
      we may find traces of their landing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would put
      us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next
      expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the forest
      near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among others,
      rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of those
      superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the name of
      Kauris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;If I were to climb to the
      top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense
      distance round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is good,&rdquo; replied the reporter; &ldquo;but could you climb to the top
      of those giants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can at least try,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the
      arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few
      minutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain of
      verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern
      portion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End on
      the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed a
      great part of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the yet
      unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the
      strangers whose presence they suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not a
      sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank of
      trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if deprived
      of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible to
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood
      formed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a
      break or an opening. It was impossible even to follow the course of the
      Mercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source.
      Perhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert&rsquo;s sight
      could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which
      would be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the
      west, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He
      strained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No,
      decidedly there was nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen returned
      to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad&rsquo;s account, shook
      his head and said nothing. It was very evident that no decided opinion
      could be pronounced on this question until after a complete exploration of
      the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after&mdash;the 28th of October&mdash;another incident occurred,
      for which an explanation was again required.
    </p>
    <p>
      While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House,
      Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen of
      the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of the species Midas, the edible
      green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks to
      reach the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help, Neb, help!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb ran up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine animal!&rdquo; said Neb; &ldquo;but how are we to catch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier, Neb,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;We have only to turn the
      turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and
      do as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and
      plastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as a
      rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by
      their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back.
      The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least
      four hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; cried Neb; &ldquo;this is something which will rejoice friend
      Pencroft&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced, for
      the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely savory.
      At this moment the creature&rsquo;s head could be seen, which was small, flat,
      but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden under the long
      roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, what shall we do with our prize?&rdquo; said Neb. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t drag it to
      Granite House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it here, since it cannot turn over,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;and we will
      come back with the cart to fetch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the best plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb
      deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after which
      the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach, which the
      tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroft, said
      nothing about the &ldquo;superb specimen of a chelonian&rdquo; which they had turned
      over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb returned with the cart
      to the place where they had left it. The &ldquo;superb specimen of a chelonian&rdquo;
       was no longer there!
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them.
      It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even found
      the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not being
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Neb, &ldquo;these beasts can turn themselves over, then?&rsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears so,&rdquo; replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all, and
      was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this
      disappearance,&rdquo; thought Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t speak
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned to
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working
      together, Herbert recounted what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the stupids!&rdquo; cried the sailor, &ldquo;to have let at least fifty meals
      escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t our fault that the beast got
      away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t turn it over enough!&rdquo; returned the obstinate sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a miracle, then!&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, captain,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;that turtles, once placed on their
      backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large
      size?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, my boy,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did it manage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?&rdquo; asked the
      engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen feet at the most,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tide was low at the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;what the turtle could not do on the sand it
      might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide
      overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what stupids we were!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!&rdquo; returned
      the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was admissible.
      But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation? It
      cannot be said that he was.

      Chapter 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft had
      kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined together
      by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in five days.
      A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve the
      equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a scull
      to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet long, and
      did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of launching it
      was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the
      sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated it. Pencroft, who
      leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and declared it to be
      just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own
      triumph. &ldquo;With this we could go round&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the
      captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well,
      captain&mdash;and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb&mdash;aren&rsquo;t
      you coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will carry
      all five of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought
      the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was
      agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following the
      shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they embarked, Neb cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing, Neb,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;the wood will get seasoned. In
      two days there won&rsquo;t be a single leak, and our boat will have no more
      water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was
      magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the
      narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much security
      as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in the
      stern in order to use the scull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern
      point of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was
      found either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the
      canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the
      surface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the
      shore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat then
      skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all Tadorn&rsquo;s
      Fens.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the
      coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved to go
      to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary to take a
      rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks which
      fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff gradually
      sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was formed of
      granite rocks, capriciously distributed, very different from the cliff at
      Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might have been said
      that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out there. There was no
      vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected two miles from the
      forest, and it thus represented a giant&rsquo;s arm stretched out from a leafy
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon
      Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the coast
      in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this
      part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the
      canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to
      move, and surround Union Bay more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the
      mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining some
      strange country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the canoe
      reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to return,
      when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I see down there on the beach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All eyes turned towards the point indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;there is something. It looks like part of a
      wreck half buried in the sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;I see what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull to the shore, Pencroft!&rdquo; said Cyrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its
      passengers leaped on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the
      sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by
      them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; replied Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s in this chest?&rdquo; cried Pencroft, with very natural impatience.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it with! Well,
      perhaps a stone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the
      sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can you restrain your impatience for one hour only?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall find that out, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;but trust to
      me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must convey
      it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without breaking it.
      It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated here, it may
      just as well float to the mouth of the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,&rdquo; replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not have
      been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest, which
      doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up.
      It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question.
      Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and
      examined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or pieces
      of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock to survey the
      sea, but there was nothing in sight&mdash;neither a dismasted vessel nor a
      ship under sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this
      incident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had
      landed on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there? But
      the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these strangers
      could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of American or
      European make.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large size.
      It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with a thick
      hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels,
      hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened to
      its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft directly
      pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a perfect
      state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it had
      stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt
      whatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the
      water, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did not
      appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it
      contained were no doubt uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some
      dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope that it
      would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it, the passengers
      had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this floating
      apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will tow this chest to Granite House,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;where we
      can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the
      survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it
      belongs. If we find no one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will keep it for ourselves!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;But what in the world
      can there be in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would
      evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly
      unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the
      canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so as to
      facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon began to
      double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep it
      above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose
      and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not
      realized, and an hour and a half after they set out&mdash;all that time
      had been taken up in going a distance of three miles&mdash;the boat
      touched the beach below Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was then
      going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home, brought
      back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that it might
      be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its inventory.
      Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good
      condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a
      cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc
      lined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged that
      the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be sheltered
      from damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Neb, &ldquo;suppose it&rsquo;s jam!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only there was&mdash;&rdquo; said the sailor in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Neb, who overheard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the
      chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were
      produced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft uttered
      fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and down.
      There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking utensils
      which Neb covered with kisses!
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this
      chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this is
      the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett&rsquo;s note-book: &mdash;Tools:&mdash;3
      knives with several blades, 2 woodmen&rsquo;s axes, 2 carpenter&rsquo;s hatchets, 3
      planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3
      gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes,
      2 boxes of needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons:&mdash;2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader
      carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each
      containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instruments:&mdash;1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of
      mathematical instruments, 1 mariner&rsquo;s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1
      aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus,
      object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothes:&mdash;2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but
      evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utensils:&mdash;1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal
      plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books:&mdash;1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian
      idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of white
      paper, 2 books with blank pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be allowed,&rdquo; said the reporter, after the inventory had been
      made, &ldquo;that the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons,
      instruments, clothes, utensils, books&mdash;nothing is wanting! It might
      really be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it
      beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is wanting, indeed,&rdquo; murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for a certainty,&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;the vessel which carried this chest
      and its owner was not a Malay pirate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;the owner had been taken prisoner by pirates&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not admissible,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;It is more probable that
      an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter, and that
      her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared this chest
      and threw it overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your opinion, captain?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;that may have been the case. It is
      possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they collected
      into this chest different articles of the greatest use in hopes of finding
      it again on the coast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the photographic box!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that apparatus,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;I do not quite see the use of
      it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition
      would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or
      books, which would tell us something about them?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined, especially
      the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor the
      instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the maker;
      they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to have been
      used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all were new,
      which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance and thrown
      into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of things had been
      well considered and arranged with care. This was also indicated by the
      second case of metal which had preserved them from damp, and which could
      not have been soldered in a moment of haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both were
      English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the date of
      publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a
      typographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in the
      world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator&rsquo;s projection, and
      of which the nomenclature was in French&mdash;but which also bore neither
      date nor name of publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which they
      could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the
      nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the
      settlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions of
      nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to their
      intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not appear
      as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these
      productions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It appeared
      that the chest did not contain something which he evidently held in great
      esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom of the box, his
      hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was
      heard to mutter these words:&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine, but you can see
      that there is nothing for me in that box!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This led Neb to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a pound of tobacco,&rdquo; replied Pencroft seriously, &ldquo;and nothing would
      have been wanting to complete my happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more
      than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore
      agreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by
      ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways had
      landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without resources, and
      it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House, where
      they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day&mdash;the 29th
      of October&mdash;happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed,
      Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the
      Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft stopped
      him, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain, I am superstitious. Open at random and read
      the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it applies to
      our situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor&rsquo;s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he
      opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a pencil,
      was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of the Gospel
      of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed
      exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary. In
      fact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no
      longer needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as the
      river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be traversed
      without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their provisions and
      arms to an advanced point in the west of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take
      with them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring back
      to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was supposed,
      there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully their prizes.
      In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use than the light
      canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult
      to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the chest had not
      contained, besides &ldquo;his halfpound of tobacco,&rdquo; a pair of strong New Jersey
      horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store of
      meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain them
      for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition. They
      hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care not to
      forget the portable stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen&rsquo;s axes, which they
      could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the
      instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely to be
      more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first only
      requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter needing
      fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited
      stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges. As
      to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds in the barrel, a
      small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer hoped to manufacture
      an explosive substance which would allow them to husband it. To the
      firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed in leather, and, thus
      supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast forest with some chance
      of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were at
      the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them promise
      not to fire a shot unless it was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had embarked,
      including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours,
      therefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for
      later the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was
      already strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was
      enough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated
      swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary to
      increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the explorers
      arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the place where,
      seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of
      great evergreen firs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his companions
      could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced by nature with
      water and trees. As they advanced the forest element diminished. On the
      right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe,
      the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which withstands well the
      action of water. Then there were numerous groups belonging to the same
      family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces a very
      useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a twining shrub
      which, when bruised in water, furnishes excellent cordage; and two or
      three ebony trees of a beautiful black, crossed with capricious veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the canoe
      was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their guns in
      their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without expecting game,
      some useful plant might be met with, and the young naturalist was
      delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach, belonging to the order
      of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of cruciferae, belonging to the
      cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be possible to cultivate by
      transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish, turnips, and lastly,
      little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than three feet high, which
      produced brownish grains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what this plant is?&rdquo; asked Herbert of the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobacco!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite plant
      except in the bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Herbert; &ldquo;this is not tobacco, it is mustard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustard be hanged!&rdquo; returned the sailor; &ldquo;but if by chance you happen to
      come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don&rsquo;t scorn that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall find it some day!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;when that day comes, I do not know what more
      will be wanting in our island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried
      to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked,
      sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer
      ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the
      river from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and
      nearly straight for a length of about three miles. But it was to be
      supposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the Mercy
      continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin, among
      which the river rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold of two
      couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin beaks,
      lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of a tail.
      Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it was resolved that
      they should be the first tenants of their future poultry-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke
      the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance of
      a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognize him!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off by
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you recognize?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we gave
      the name to that part of the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jacamar!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic
      luster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe.
      At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory is of the
      size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of the wings
      crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy belonged the
      honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories are better food
      than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough, but it was difficult
      to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the king of eatable birds. It
      was ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the canoe reached a second angle of
      the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth. Here a halt was made for
      breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees. The river still measured
      from sixty to seventy feet in breadth, and its bed from five to six feet
      in depth. The engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous
      affluents, but they were unnavigable, being simply little streams. As to
      the forest, including Jacamar Wood, as well as the forests of the Far
      West, it extended as far as the eye could reach. In no place, either in
      the depths of the forests or under the trees on the banks of the Mercy,
      was the presence of man revealed. The explorers could not discover one
      suspicious trace. It was evident that the woodman&rsquo;s axe had never touched
      these trees, that the pioneer&rsquo;s knife had never severed the creepers
      hanging from one trunk to another in the midst of tangled brushwood and
      long grass. If castaways had landed on the island, they could not have yet
      quitted the shore, and it was not in the woods that the survivors of the
      supposed shipwreck should be sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western
      coast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according
      to his estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards
      the shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they
      should use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel to
      float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would have
      been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes. But
      soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going down, and
      it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this distance from
      the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of the oars.
      Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull. The forest
      soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite
      isolated. But the further they were from each other the more magnificent
      they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air which
      circulated around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly their
      presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without hesitation
      the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eucalypti!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the extratropical
      zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand eucalyptus, both
      situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose to a height
      of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in
      circumference, and their bark was covered by a network of farrows
      containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more wonderful or more
      singular than those enormous specimens of the order of the myrtaceae, with
      their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally, so that an edge and
      not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that the sun&rsquo;s rays
      penetrate more freely among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and from
      the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the
      sunlight like winged rubies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are something like trees!&rdquo; cried Neb; &ldquo;but are they good for
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;Of course there are vegetable giants as well as
      human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at fairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and
      that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously
      employed in cabinet-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I may add,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;that the eucalyptus belongs to a family
      which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit
      guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the
      pomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora, the
      fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which
      contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which
      the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence
      comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and berries spice
      is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields a sweet sort of
      manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is transformed into beer by
      fermentation; in short, all those trees known under the name of gum-trees
      or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong to this family of the myrtaceae,
      which contains forty-six genera and thirteen hundred species!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical
      lecture with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and Pencroft
      with an indescribable feeling of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Herbert,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;but I could swear that all those
      useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them giants like
      these!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That supports what I said,&rdquo; returned the sailor, &ldquo;namely, that these
      giants are good for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are wrong, Pencroft,&rdquo; said the engineer; &ldquo;these gigantic
      eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what they
      are called in Australia and New Zealand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are called &lsquo;fever trees.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they give fevers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because they prevent them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. I must note that,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence of
      the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote has
      been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the north of
      Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the sanitary condition
      of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No more intermittent
      fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests of the myrtaceae.
      This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy circumstance for us
      settlers in Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;I tell you,
      it wants nothing&mdash;unless it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will come, Pencroft, that will be found,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;but
      now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will carry
      our boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst
      of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods of this
      portion of the island. The space which they occupied extended as far as
      the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along between
      high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds, and even by
      pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult. The action of
      the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push with a pole. They
      found also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower, and that
      the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already sinking towards the horizon,
      and the trees threw long shadows on the ground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that
      he could not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey,
      resolved to camp at the place where any further navigation was prevented
      by want of water. He calculated that they were still five or six miles
      from the coast, and this distance was too great for them to attempt during
      the night in the midst of unknown woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became thicker
      again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the eyes of the
      sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing
      among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of these animals stopped at a
      little distance from the canoe and gazed at the settlers without
      manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first time, they had not
      yet learned to fear them. It would have been easy to bring down one of
      these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was greatly tempted to fire,
      but Harding opposed so useless a massacre. This was prudent, for the
      monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and extremely
      active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary aggression, and the
      creatures might, ignorant of the power of the explorers&rsquo; firearms, have
      attacked them. It is true that the sailor considered the monkeys from a
      purely alimentary point of view, for those animals which are herbivorous
      make very excellent game; but since they had an abundant supply of
      provisions, it was a pity to waste their ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards four o&rsquo;clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly
      difficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks. The
      banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the spurs
      of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off, since it was fed by
      the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;we shall be obliged to stop,
      captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for
      the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what distance are we from Granite House?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About seven miles,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;taking into calculation,
      however, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the northwest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go on?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as long as we can,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;To-morrow, at break of
      day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the
      distance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the
      whole day in which to explore the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was now
      not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower overhead,
      and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the noise of a waterfall,
      which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural
      barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through
      the trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it was
      moored to a trunk near the right bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through the
      thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray
      sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was
      lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source. The
      different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river
      further down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists
      disembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among the
      branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was
      necessary, take refuge for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was
      only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious nature
      had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for the night,
      so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb and Pencroft
      also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought they saw the
      dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp among the bushes,
      but the night passed without incident, and the next day, the 31st of
      October, at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, all were on foot, ready for a
      start.

      Chapter 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was six o&rsquo; clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty
      breakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of the
      island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding had said two
      hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the obstacles they
      might meet with. As it was probable that they would have to cut a path
      through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe in hand, and
      with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries of the wild
      beasts heard in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing of
      Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance of
      less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the southwest
      to reach the western coast. They set out, having first carefully secured
      the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient provision for the little
      band for at least two days. It would not thus be necessary to hunt. The
      engineer advised his companions to refrain from firing, that their
      presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore. The first
      hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the midst of some
      mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass in his hand,
      Cyrus Harding led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already
      been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There were deodars,
      Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus, cedars, and
      other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number prevented
      their growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which
      constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the
      luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some
      subterranean marsh or by some stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not
      remember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any
      other watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of
      monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose
      appearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether these
      active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his companions as
      degenerate brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by
      creepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple
      animals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing on
      their course. The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not manifest
      any hostile disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two or
      three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or two
      words to say to you on our way back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown
      stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed
      foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek
      was deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are cut off!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;it is only a stream, and we can easily swim over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the use of that?&rdquo; returned Harding. &ldquo;This creek evidently
      runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and I
      shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the coast.
      Forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;The name of this creek, my friends? Do
      not let us leave our geography incomplete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, my boy,&rdquo; said the engineer, addressing the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?&rdquo;
       answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;Let us follow it as fast as we can
      without stopping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still another minute!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,&rdquo; said the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no time to lose,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! five minutes!&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;I only ask for five minutes to use
      in the interest of our breakfast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water, and
      soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These will be good!&rdquo; cried Neb, going to the sailor&rsquo;s aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!&rdquo; muttered
      Pencroft with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in
      the creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a
      cobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in
      the forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of a
      large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none
      were actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest
      that the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a
      grinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to
      suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western
      coast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising
      tide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had
      only been a few miles distant. Now, this effect was not produced, and the
      water pursued its natural course. The engineer was much astonished at
      this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that some
      turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less
      tumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the
      left bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them; but
      these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not bark, and
      the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the presence of any
      stranger in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who was
      a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay extended
      before the eyes of the settlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which chance
      had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a sandy beach.
      The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending over the water
      were beaten by the waves. It was not such a shore as is usually formed by
      nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand, or by grouping masses
      of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the most splendid trees. The
      bank was raised a little above the level of the sea, and on this luxuriant
      soil, supported by a granite base, the fine forest trees seemed to be as
      firmly planted as in the interior of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor,
      which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It
      served as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that its
      waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a height
      of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was not felt
      up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum
      elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless,
      millions of years would pass before the water would have worn away the
      granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this
      stream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for a
      space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond that
      again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line, which ran
      north and south. On the contrary, all the part of the shore between Falls
      River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent trees, some
      straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed their roots. Now,
      it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine Peninsula, that was to be
      explored, for this part of the shore offered a refuge to castaways, which
      the other wild and barren side must have refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which
      Neb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There
      was, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore
      as far as the eye could reach. But the engineer would take nothing for
      granted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the
      Serpentine Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave
      the signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff
      or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of
      the trees so that they might continue on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about twelve
      miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this, on a clear
      ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they needed double
      the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut down, and
      creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these obstacles
      greatly lengthening their journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place
      recently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of it
      might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted that
      because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been castaway on
      the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter&rsquo;s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the bullet
      proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within three
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already five o&rsquo;clock, and there were still two miles between the
      settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident
      that after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would
      not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source of
      the Mercy. It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the
      promontory. But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for there
      were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary, abound&mdash;jacamars,
      couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots, cockatoos, pheasants,
      pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not a tree without a nest, and
      not a nest which was not full of flapping wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards seven o&rsquo;clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here the
      seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance of a
      coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something might
      be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration had to be
      put off to the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their camp.
      Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found several
      thick clumps of bamboos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;this is a valuable discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valuable?&rdquo; returned Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;I may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the
      bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this
      bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper;
      that the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes and are
      used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent material for
      building, being light and strong, and being never attacked by insects. I
      will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint, keeping for the
      bottom the part of the transverse film which forms the joint, useful cups
      are obtained, which are much in use among the Chinese. No! you don&rsquo;t care
      for that. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these
      bamboos are eaten like asparagus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asparagus thirty feet high!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor. &ldquo;And are they good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;Only it is not the stems of thirty feet
      high which are eaten, but the young shoots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect, my boy, perfect!&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in vinegar,
      makes a good pickle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better and better, Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made into
      a very agreeable drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t happen to do for smoking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my poor Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass
      the night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the sea
      under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many cavities
      in which shelter could be found against the night air. But just as they
      were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;Our guns are only loaded with small shot, and
      beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for
      grains of salt!&rdquo; And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged him
      behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance
      of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that is
      to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the
      beginning of its tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by
      streaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the white
      of its chest. Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of the tiger,
      as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest wolf!
    </p>
    <p>
      The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair
      bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking
      that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when
      Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This was not his
      first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained
      motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle. The jaguar
      collected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in the
      eyes, and it fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran
      up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it lay
      stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be a
      great ornament to the hall at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!&rdquo; cried Herbert, in a fit of
      very natural enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;you could have done the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! with such coolness!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you
      would fire as quietly as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; rejoined Pencroft, &ldquo;that it is not more dangerous than a hare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;since the jaguar has left its abode, I do
      not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But others may come,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,&rdquo; said
      the reporter, &ldquo;and no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the jaguar&rsquo;s house, then!&rdquo; replied the sailor, dragging after him
      the body of the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant supply
      of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he
      mingled with the other fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with
      bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they
      had supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood
      piled at the entrance was set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion,
      or rather a series of reports, broke the silence! The noise was caused by
      the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like fireworks.
      The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud
      explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it for
      many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable wild
      beasts of Central Asia.

    <h2>
      Chapter 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave
      which the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and
      their gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of the
      circumference were visible. For the last time the engineer could ascertain
      that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and even with the
      telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line of
      three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for beyond
      that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity
      of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now should
      they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was
      abandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after
      having surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to
      Granite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought that the western coast
      would have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel in
      her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no good
      anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been able to
      find on the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question of
      the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what
      distance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thirty miles,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;if we take into consideration
      the curvings of the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty miles!&rdquo; returned Spilett. &ldquo;That would be a long day&rsquo;s march.
      Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the south
      coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Herbert, &ldquo;from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be at
      least another ten miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it forty miles in all,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;and do not hesitate
      to do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall
      not have to begin the exploration again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;But the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the Mercy,&rdquo;
       replied Gideon Spilett; &ldquo;it may just as well stay there two days! As yet,
      we have had no reason to think that the island is infested by thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;when I remember the history of the turtle, I am
      far from confident of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The turtle! the turtle!&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the
      sea turned it over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&mdash;&rdquo; said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and
      yet said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to say, Neb?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we return by the shore to Claw Cape,&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;after having
      doubled the Cape, we shall be stopped&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Mercy! of course,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;and we shall have neither
      bridge nor boat by which to cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, captain,&rdquo; added Pencroft, &ldquo;with a few floating trunks we shall have
      no difficulty in crossing the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;it will be useful to construct a bridge if we
      wish to have an easy access to the Far West!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bridge!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;Well, is not the captain the best engineer in
      his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to
      transporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that
      without wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We
      have provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game.
      Forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter&rsquo;s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received
      general approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest, and
      by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there was
      not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they could not
      hope to reach Granite House before night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution the
      guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received orders to
      beat about the edge of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the
      peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was
      rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations bringing
      to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no debris, no mark
      of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a footprint!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their gaze
      could extend along the southwest. Twenty-five miles off the coast
      terminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning mists,
      and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if suspended
      between land and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the
      immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land,
      bordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more irregular,
      projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in the black rocks
      which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers
      took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a vessel ran in here,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;she would certainly be lost.
      Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at least something would be left of the ship,&rdquo; observed the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,&rdquo;
       replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they
      swallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of a
      ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Pencroft,&rdquo; asked the engineer, &ldquo;if a ship has been wrecked on these
      banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her remaining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be
      surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should not
      have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on with our search, then,&rdquo; returned Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington Bay,
      they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then halted for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and sandbanks.
      The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in the bay,
      forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach was very
      narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which
      encumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in
      height, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half an hour&rsquo;s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not a
      spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed
      into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they
      found nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them.
      They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there, but
      these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy means of
      communication had been established between the two banks of the Mercy, and
      until the means of transport had been perfected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be
      found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull of
      a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spars would
      have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was found
      twenty miles from here. But there was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards three o&rsquo;clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug little
      creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea, and was
      entered by a narrow channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky
      border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper plateau,
      which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and
      consequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon
      Spilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here. They
      agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites; and although
      it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to strengthen himself
      with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain them until their
      supper, which they intended to take at Granite House. In a few minutes the
      settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines, were devouring the
      provisions which Neb produced from his bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the sea.
      The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union Bay.
      Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not be from
      thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which the
      explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon with his
      glass, no vessel could be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the
      water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of
      the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;it seems we must make up our minds to
      console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us
      the possession of Lincoln Island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bullet,&rdquo; cried Herbert. &ldquo;That was not imaginary, I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what conclusion may be drawn?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;that three months or more ago, a vessel,
      either voluntarily or not, came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving
      any trace?&rdquo; cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human being
      set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now left
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if I understand you right, captain,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;the vessel has
      left again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?&rdquo; said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can&rsquo;t be
      helped,&rdquo; said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog
      issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his master
      to follow him into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s something to explain the bullet!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A castaway!&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded, perhaps!&rdquo; said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or dead!&rdquo; added the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest.
      Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an
      emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment,
      they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way. Shrubs
      and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away with the
      axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest. It was
      difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there, but yet
      Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at random, but
      like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with
      tall trees. The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither under
      the bushes nor among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Top?&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at
      once Pencroft shouted,&mdash;&ldquo;Ho, splendid! capital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; and here we&rsquo;ve found one in the air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the
      pine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not a wreck!&rdquo; cried Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; returned Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? is it&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been
      caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a
      tremendous hurrah, adding,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for years.
      There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr. Spilett,
      what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island
      that the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had
      fallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it
      again, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether they
      wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully employed
      the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality. Pencroft&rsquo;s
      joy was therefore shared by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the
      tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb, Herbert,
      and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all their skill
      to disengage the now reduced balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its
      valve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that is
      to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the circle and
      the anchor. The case, except for the fracture, was in good condition, only
      the lower portion being torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, captain,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;if we ever decide to leave the
      island, it won&rsquo;t be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won&rsquo;t go where
      we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way! Look
      here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can make a
      main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the rest of it,
      that will help to dress us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding; &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,&rdquo; said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth, ropes, and
      cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very considerable, and
      while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to convey it, it was of
      importance that this treasure should not be left longer exposed to the
      mercies of the first storm. The settlers, uniting their efforts, managed
      to drag it as far as the shore, where they discovered a large rocky
      cavity, which owing to its position could not be visited either by the
      wind or rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We needed a locker, and now we have one,&rdquo; said Pencroft; &ldquo;but as we
      cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don&rsquo;t mean
      from two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek the
      very suitable name of &ldquo;Port Balloon,&rdquo; the settlers pursued their way along
      Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different projects
      which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest possible
      delay. It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the Mercy, so
      as to establish an easy communication with the south of the island; then
      the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the canoe alone
      could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and Pencroft
      would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake voyages of
      circumnavigation round the island, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the settlers
      reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four
      miles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the
      mouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by the
      Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross,
      but as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he was
      compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty tired.
      The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the balloon had
      not rested either their arms or legs. They were anxious to reach Granite
      House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been constructed, in a
      quarter of an hour they would have been at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by
      constructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy. He
      and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began to
      attack them at the base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their
      companions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though
      without going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had strolled by
      the river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is floating there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through
      the gloom,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A canoe!&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down
      the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boat ahoy!&rdquo; shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would be
      best to keep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve
      feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down the
      current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our boat?&rdquo; murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had
      undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the
      Mercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should
      have swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft
      cleverly managed this by means of a long pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found, on
      examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing
      against the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the reporter to him, in a low voice, &ldquo;this is a strange
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange indeed!&rdquo; returned Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and
      Pencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having been
      worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the boat
      should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to seize it
      on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would have been
      lost in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would have
      given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some
      supernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the Mercy.
      The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all proceeded
      towards the ladder of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the
      first steps, uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer a ladder!
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions searched
      in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have moved the
      ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen down.... But
      the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if a squall had blown
      it on the landing-place, half way up, that was impossible in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a joke,&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;it is a very stupid one! To come home
      and find no staircase to go up to your room by&mdash;that&rsquo;s nothing for
      weary men to laugh at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neb could do nothing but cry out &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!&rdquo; said
      Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious?&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be
      more natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of
      our dwelling and drawn up the ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one,&rdquo; cried the sailor. &ldquo;But who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if there is any one up there,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, who began to lose
      patience, &ldquo;I will give them a hail, and they must answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; which was
      echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling
      laugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to
      Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic of men,
      and the settlers were not men of that description. In their situation
      every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the seven months
      which they had spent on the island, they had not before met with anything
      of so surprising a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the
      event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think, not
      knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of a
      satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more unlikely
      than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not being able
      to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they had had on their
      expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; at last said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;there is only one thing to be
      done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.
      But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if we
      cannot eat, we can at least sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is it that has played us this cool trick?&rdquo; again asked Pencroft,
      unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer
      proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile
      Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and
      when Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The brave
      dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master with his
      companions sought a refuge among the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on the
      sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that they
      were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened, whether
      it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at the return
      of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human being; but
      they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be helped, however,
      for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling was occupied, and
      they could not possibly enter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse.
      There were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments,
      tools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be
      pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again,
      fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their uneasiness
      led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to see if Top
      was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his habitual
      patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted
      with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for
      allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to gain an influence
      over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this respect, and the two
      conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable circumstance which
      baffled even their intelligence and experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a joke,&rdquo; said Pencroft; &ldquo;it is a trick some one has played us.
      Well, I don&rsquo;t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for
      himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists,
      suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising sun
      now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters of
      which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that
      the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one had entered Granite House&mdash;there could be no more doubt
      about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing, was
      in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the
      threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard
      themselves against a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft hailed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beggars,&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor. &ldquo;There they are sleeping quietly as
      if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands,
      robbers, sons of John Bull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of &ldquo;son of
      John Bull,&rdquo; he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House
      became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the
      exterior all was quiet and calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the
      position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also
      certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able to
      escape. But how were they to be got at?
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the
      arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which
      hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then be able to
      draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the communication
      between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently nothing else to
      be done, and, with a little skill, this method might succeed. Very
      fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also
      found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft fastened this to a
      well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a careful
      aim for the lower part of the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see
      if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his
      shoulder and covered the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed
      between the two last rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when
      he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out
      between the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rascals!&rdquo; shouted the sailor. &ldquo;If a ball can do anything for you, you
      shall not have long to wait for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was it?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it? Didn&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a
      sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the
      ladder during our absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor&rsquo;s
      words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows, from
      which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real proprietors
      of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that it was only a joke,&rdquo; cried Pencroft; &ldquo;but one of the jokers
      shall pay the penalty for the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the
      monkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded
      on the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged
      to the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an
      orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who are
      so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert
      declared it to be an orangoutang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a magnificent beast!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent, if you like,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;but still I do not see how
      we are to get into our house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert is a good marksman,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and his bow is here. He
      can try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, these apes are so cunning,&rdquo; returned Pencroft; &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t show
      themselves again at the windows and so we can&rsquo;t kill them; and when I
      think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience,&rdquo; replied Harding; &ldquo;these creatures cannot keep us long at
      bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,&rdquo; replied the
      sailor. &ldquo;And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows
      are up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making
      another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had
      been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the line
      broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing.
      Pencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did not
      think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by
      reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders,
      but when and how? this is what they were not able to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show themselves,
      but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or a paw was
      poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted by a
      gun-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hide ourselves,&rdquo; at last said the engineer. &ldquo;Perhaps the apes will
      think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let Spilett
      and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on all that may
      appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad, the
      best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position, but out
      of the monkeys&rsquo; sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the plateau and
      entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was now time for
      breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they
      roasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett and
      Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to watch
      under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The quadrumana
      gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed that they had
      disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that, terrified by the
      death of one of their companions, and frightened by the noise of the
      firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house or probably
      even into the store-room. And when they thought of the valuables which
      this storeroom contained, the patience so much recommended by the
      engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and there certainly was room
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly it is too bad,&rdquo; said the reporter; &ldquo;and the worst of it is,
      there is no way of putting an end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,&rdquo; cried the sailor. &ldquo;We
      could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the
      rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is there
      no way of getting at them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,&rdquo;
       replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; shouted the sailor, &ldquo;and I never thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite House
      so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was, it is
      true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be
      necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately,
      Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening
      by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have taken
      some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already past twelve o&rsquo;clock, when the colonists, well armed and
      provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the
      windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and
      began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect
      Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the
      dog barking furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all rushed down the bank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause,
      were trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window to
      another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to replace
      the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps in their
      terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists, now being
      able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or killed, fell
      back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest, throwing
      themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few minutes,
      so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then unroll
      and fall to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the sailor, &ldquo;this is queer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very strange!&rdquo; murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, captain!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;perhaps there are still some of
      these rascals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; replied the engineer, without stopping however.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the
      threshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor in
      the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, and the ladder,&rdquo; cried the sailor; &ldquo;who can the gentleman have
      been who sent us that down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden
      himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the robber!&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when
      Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare him, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon this rascal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was difficult
      to know whether he spoke seriously or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself
      gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;And what shall we make of him, now we&rsquo;ve got
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A servant!&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent
      race could be turned to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He
      belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is
      not much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an
      orangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor the
      stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes that
      so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed of an
      almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at table,
      sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon
      properly, and even drink wine... doing everything as well as the best
      servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one of these
      apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great
      fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad chest,
      head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees,
      round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy hair, in
      short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather smaller than
      human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth glittered under
      his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handsome fellow!&rdquo; said Pencroft; &ldquo;if we only knew his language, we
      could talk to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, master,&rdquo; said Neb, &ldquo;are you serious? Are we going to take him as a
      servant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Neb,&rdquo; replied the engineer, smiling. &ldquo;But you must not be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope he will make an excellent servant,&rdquo; added Herbert. &ldquo;He appears
      young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged to use
      force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He will
      soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they will be,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor
      against &ldquo;the jokers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, approaching the orang,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old boy!&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to join the colony?&rdquo; again asked the sailor. &ldquo;You are going to
      enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Third affirmative grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This conversation is slightly monotonous,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;the best servants are those who
      talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give you
      no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are pleased
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor
      begged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be
      called Jupiter, and Jup for short.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.

    <h2>
      Chapter 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without
      having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore
      spared the trouble of mason&rsquo;s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the
      moment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized with
      that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven them out
      of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they were about to be
      attacked from another direction? This was the only explanation of their
      sudden retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where
      they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the
      disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although
      they had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken
      nothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished a
      substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds and
      rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had
      unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they
      were more sure of his submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round
      their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most
      pressing. The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a
      bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern
      part of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure for
      the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their
      clothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy the
      transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and
      the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply them
      with winter clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s intention to establish it at
      the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and
      abundant pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of the
      stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the first,
      the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if they
      could manage to capture some animals to draw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far
      from Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to
      which Neb called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary
      that the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place
      appeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard
      than that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple of
      tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be
      domesticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the
      construction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this important
      task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the settlers, who,
      now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Pencroft observed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to
      draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us tie its lower end down firmly,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then the
      settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the angle
      formed by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown
      across. The place appeared suitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on the
      southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a half, and
      from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good cart-road
      which would render the communication between Granite House and the south
      of the island extremely easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely
      isolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of
      quadrupeds and quadrumana. In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the
      poultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used
      for cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals.
      Nothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how the
      engineer intended to set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either
      artificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant, from
      the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the lake
      for the escape of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which
      had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above and
      below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a
      little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern
      border by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the
      mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the
      bridge was to be established.
    </p>
    <p>
      The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the
      river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile,
      which was open to all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a
      broad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow of
      which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy. The
      level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh
      discharge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the volume
      of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the
      execution of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then,&rdquo; added the engineer, &ldquo;Prospect Heights will become a regular
      island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating
      with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw
      across the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and
      below the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be
      constructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across
      to the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if these bridges can be raised at
      will, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down,
      stripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The
      end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be
      firm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it
      might be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are
      managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully
      conducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty feet
      wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so
      as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a pile-driver to act
      on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two arches and allow the
      bridge to support heavy loads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor of
      iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a
      marvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions,
      who in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of
      their tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon
      Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself. &ldquo;Who would
      ever have expected so much from a newspaper man!&rdquo; thought Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard
      work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the weather
      being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed
      to his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very
      inquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not as
      yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the limits
      of the plateau should be settled by the projected works. Top and Jup were
      good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did everything
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part,
      balanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was
      needed to raise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which it
      rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was
      sufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they
      were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be
      necessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to
      beat a road through the dense forests of the Far West. This would take
      some time. Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state of
      things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would suffer
      no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that the work
      at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; observed Pencroft, &ldquo;will enable us to establish our poultry-yard
      under better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes
      nor the attacks of other beasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; added Neb, &ldquo;we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And prepare our second corn-field!&rdquo; cried the sailor with a triumphant
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered
      admirably, thanks to Pencroft&rsquo;s care. It had produced the ten ears
      foretold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the
      colony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six months,
      which promised a double harvest each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved,
      were to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed on
      the single grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and
      pointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to
      birds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft&rsquo;s ingenious brain, were enough to
      frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very
      regular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was
      to close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to
      the angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable
      earth, and below that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture
      some more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed
      work. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep, was
      dug out in the hard ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by the
      same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream, to
      which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an
      affluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the
      lake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the bed
      of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand
      supported by means of stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished,
      and Prospect Heights&mdash;that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon,
      having a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid belt&mdash;was
      completely protected from depredators of every description.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it,
      however, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to
      possess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been
      completed, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his
      masters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though
      very powerful and wonderfully active. He was already taught to make
      himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones which
      were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the
      southeastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and in it
      were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to populate it.
      These were simply built of branches and divided into compartments, made
      ready for the expected guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number of
      young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to the
      borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which the
      wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage rival
      the golden pheasants. A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of
      gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers, magnificent
      alectors, which soon became tame. As to pelicans, kingfishers, water-hens,
      they came of themselves to the shores of the poultry-yard, and this little
      community, after some disputes, cooing, screaming, clucking, ended by
      settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging proportion for the
      future use of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a
      pigeon-house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a dozen of
      those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds soon
      became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling, and
      showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their congeners,
      the wood-pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by cutting
      it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in its
      present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas, above a
      sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists
      employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more
      manageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to be
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the
      place of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;a beast of burden would be very useful to us
      until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some day
      we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a branch
      line to Mount Franklin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and
      barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise. The
      settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious
      incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently
      ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said
      they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape,
      dove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head and
      neck. They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at
      the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are onagers!&rdquo; cried Herbert, &ldquo;animals something between the zebra
      and the quagga!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not donkeys?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donkeys or horses,&rdquo; interrupted Pencroft, &ldquo;they are &lsquo;moving powers,&rsquo; as
      the captain would say, and as such must be captured!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass to
      the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were
      prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No. It
      was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam freely
      about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the engineer
      immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard, in which the
      onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left
      entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to
      terrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to
      leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains and
      forests. They were then seen following the water-barrier which everywhere
      presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then galloping
      through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain entire hours
      gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and some
      days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready, but a
      straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the forests of
      the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon. The cart might
      then be driven there, and towards the end of December they tried the
      onagers for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand,
      and they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once
      harnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it
      was not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager,
      being less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness in the
      mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been acclimatized
      in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals&rsquo; 
      heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle
      arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and
      rigging of the balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy
      bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach.
      The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and
      Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh of
      satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House.

      Chapter 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen
      garments required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used by
      sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn was
      sewn firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s idea of
      re-employing that which had been already used in the covering of the
      balloon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett
      and Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it
      irritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part of
      the business. Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable
      aptitude for tailoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means of
      soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a way
      that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural
      softness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere, it
      soon became perfectly white. Some dozen shirts and sock&mdash;the latter
      not knitted, of course, but made of cotton&mdash;were thus manufactured.
      What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean
      linen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled about
      that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the couches at
      Granite House into quite comfortable beds!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which
      were greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America.
      We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched
      the feet of the wearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but the
      hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries,
      capybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and
      Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot
      uselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he
      took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in the
      box, and which he wished to reserve for the future. How did he know where
      chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the event of their
      leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare for the unknown future by
      husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it some easily
      renewable substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he
      employed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets,
      not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each charge
      contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this deficiency. As
      to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make that also, for he
      had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but this preparation
      requires extreme care, and without special tools it is difficult to
      produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore, to manufacture
      pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is not
      indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may be used, and
      this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton, but in the
      textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the elder, etc. Now,
      the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek, and the
      colonists had already made coffee of the berries of these shrubs, which
      belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the
      other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only
      fuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal,
      had already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the
      saltpeter with which nature supplied him. He accordingly resolved to
      manufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences, that
      is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive inflammability,
      since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead of two
      hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous deflagration which might
      damage the firearms. On the other hand, the advantages of pyroxyle consist
      in this, that it is not injured by damp, that it does not make the
      gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four times that of ordinary
      powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid
      for a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing
      could be more simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not
      the fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits
      white vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting
      for the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from
      three to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer
      obtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore soon had a
      perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced
      admirable results.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and the
      rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers.
      Several excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of the
      Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of wild
      vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful culture
      would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which the
      settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal were also
      carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving the
      roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.
      As fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine, its
      inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made
      plantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and
      furnished excellent molluscs. Besides that, the fishing, either in the
      lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some lines,
      armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine trout, and a
      species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow, and which
      were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was skilled in the culinary
      art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of fare. Bread alone was wanting
      at the table of the settlers, and as has been said, they felt this
      privation greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of Cape
      Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little mounds,
      concealing perfectly spherical turtles&rsquo; eggs, with white hard shells, the
      albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds&rsquo; eggs. They were
      hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as each
      turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A regular egg-field,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and we have nothing to do
      but to pick them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after the
      producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back to
      Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable from
      an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup, flavored with aromatic
      herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores
      for the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and
      ascended the country for several miles. It was the time at which the
      females, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the
      males and make a great noise through the fresh water. A thousand of these
      fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up the
      river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across the
      stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and stored
      for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render fishing
      impracticable. By this time the intelligent Jup was raised to the duty of
      valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen breeches, and an
      apron, the pockets of which were his delight. The clever orang had been
      marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have said that the Negro and
      the ape understood each other when they talked together. Jup had besides a
      real affection for Neb, and Neb returned it. When his services were not
      required, either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some
      tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen, where he
      endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he saw him do. The black showed the
      greatest patience and even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil, and the
      pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence in profiting by the lessons he
      received from his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite
      House when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one day,
      napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he acquitted
      himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes, pouring out
      water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to the settlers,
      and which enraptured Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup, some soup!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup, a little agouti!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup, a plate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted,
      replied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a
      knowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said to
      him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at
      Granite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest
      without showing any wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him
      walking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried on
      his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to gather some fruit from the
      summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the wheel of the cart
      stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of his
      shoulder put it right again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a jolly fellow he is!&rdquo; cried Pencroft often. &ldquo;If he was as
      mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in the
      center of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be
      established near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount
      Franklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have
      been troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who
      were to supply the wool for the settlers&rsquo; winter garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented
      only by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the
      Creek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road to
      which the name of Corral Road had been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the
      mountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of
      trees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes which
      closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and it was not too much
      shaded by the trees which grew about it. This meadow was to be surrounded
      by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile animals from
      leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to contain a hundred
      musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they might produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and they
      would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction
      of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had already
      necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were brought
      and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks, for
      besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the
      animals could take shelter. These buildings had also to be made very
      strong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be
      feared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire, had
      been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props assured
      the solidity of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented by
      the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful
      summer&rsquo;s day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well
      trained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and
      gradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, Neb,
      and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while the two
      cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine
      animals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of the
      ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running
      and riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded,
      more than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and ten
      wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open door of
      which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and were
      prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to
      complain. There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at no
      distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.
      However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day to
      visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade,
      but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming more
      tranquil.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The
      daily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the
      roads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which,
      starting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast. The yet
      unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered Serpentine
      Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon Spilett was
      so anxious to clear their domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given to
      the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from the
      forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion
      without bringing home some useful vegetable. One day, it was some
      specimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an
      excellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic
      qualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers,
      which have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of
      which more than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden, now
      well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided into small
      beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips, radishes, and
      other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau was particularly fertile, and it
      was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did
      not demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to
      complain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the
      roots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from the
      young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled and
      fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans
      spring-beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of a couple
      of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species, characterized by
      a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose upper mandible was
      prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage; and also some
      magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks, the comb, caruncle,
      and epidermis being black. So far, everything had succeeded, thanks to the
      activity of these courageous and intelligent men. Nature did much for
      them, doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made a right use
      of what a bountiful Providence gave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work
      was finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the
      edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers,
      which Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they instructed
      each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of the sailor always
      amused this little world, in which the most perfect harmony had never
      ceased to reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What
      was the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly
      prolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General
      Grant. The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the
      last action of this terrible struggle. Now the North had triumphed in the
      good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in
      Lincoln Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the
      rest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time
      the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which the
      balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere
      castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable lives
      from the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of their
      captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists,
      furnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn to
      their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is to
      say, the three kingdoms of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to his
      companions more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled at
      Herbert&rsquo;s ideas or Pencroft&rsquo;s nonsense, but always and everywhere he
      pondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which the
      secret still escaped him!

    <h2>
      Chapter 9
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a full
      moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive. The
      atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some length
      of tempestuous weather was to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the
      east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like volleys of
      grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately closed, or everything in
      the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing these hailstones, some of
      which were the size of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg, Pencroft&rsquo;s first thought was that
      his cornfield was in serious danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already
      appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled
      without cessation in the depths of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited by the
      bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the arrangement of
      which was becoming more complete from day to day. The engineer made a
      turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles both for the toilet
      and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of which was greatly felt.
      A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which were kept with extreme
      care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left incomplete. They sawed,
      they planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole of this bad
      season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming of the
      turning-lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back,
      near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter,
      which perfectly suited his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With good old Jup there is never any quarreling,&rdquo; often repeated
      Pencroft, &ldquo;never any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes, he
      turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered wood,
      and he performed another admirable piece of service which delighted
      Pencroft&mdash;he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck up the
      worthy sailor in his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana,
      quadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life
      in the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone,
      working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness
      would ever attack them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches in
      the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he promised
      to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally. Besides he
      improved himself during the leisure hours which manual occupations left to
      him; he read the books found in the case; and after the practical lessons
      which were taught by the very necessity of their position, he found in the
      engineer for science, and the reporter for languages, masters who were
      delighted to complete his education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered
      with clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere,
      violently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its
      former purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for
      three or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About this
      time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to the
      same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral, the
      flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already bleated in
      the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had each their
      favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made for the
      domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was
      constructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young ones
      in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat under Neb&rsquo;s
      care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their daily nourishment,
      leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself conscientiously of his
      task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense of his little pensioners
      by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief, and not wickedness, for
      these little twisted tails amused him like a plaything, and his instinct
      was that of a child. One day in this month of March, Pencroft, talking to
      the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the latter had not
      as yet had time to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long
      ladders at Granite House, captain,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you make it some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us
      think a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but for
      things it is necessary. It isn&rsquo;t very convenient to climb up a long ladder
      when one is heavily loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have no machine at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A steam machine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a water machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at
      the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great difficulty.
      For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little stream which
      supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The opening among the
      stones and grass was then increased, thus producing a strong fall at the
      bottom of the passage, the overflow from which escaped by the inner well.
      Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which was
      joined on the exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a
      basket. In this way, by means of a long rope reaching to the ground, which
      enabled them to regulate the motive power, they could rise in the basket
      to the door of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and
      gave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal,
      provisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this simple
      system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be supposed, no
      one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was enchanted with
      this improvement, for he had not, and never could have possessed Master
      Jup&rsquo;s skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on Neb&rsquo;s back, or even
      on that of the orang that he had been obliged to make the ascent to
      Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding attempted to
      manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln to this new
      use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several
      fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory, which
      Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did not leave for
      several days. As to the substances used in the composition of glass, they
      are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or sulphate. Now the
      beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds supplied soda, pyrites
      supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to
      the wished-for temperature. Cyrus Harding thus soon had everything ready
      for setting to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was the
      pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which
      collects on one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of a
      long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft
      succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand,
      thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three
      parts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in
      crucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a
      liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube a
      quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously
      arranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed the
      tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the
      tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time&mdash;that his breath
      dilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state of
      fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a
      bubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube out
      of Herbert&rsquo;s hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by
      lengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two
      hemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron
      dipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was cut
      lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second heating,
      it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this
      operation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House
      were soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still
      sufficiently transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with
      them, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had
      asked to be allowed to &ldquo;blow&rdquo; in his turn, and it was great fun for him;
      but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes,
      which he admired immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest
      of the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the lad was
      asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them heartily.
      Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other side, Herbert
      was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of kangaroos,
      capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however, escaped the
      lad&rsquo;s gun; the consequence was that the day was already advanced, and the
      two hunters were in danger of having made a useless excursion, when
      Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?&rdquo; and he pointed to a shrub,
      rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a
      scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a &lsquo;cycas revoluta,&rsquo; of which I have a picture in our dictionary of
      Natural History!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see any fruit on this shrub!&rdquo; observed his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; replied Herbert; &ldquo;but its stem contains a flour with which
      nature has provided us all ready ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, then, the bread-tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the bread-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;this is a valuable discovery, since
      our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not mistaken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was composed
      of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith, traversed
      with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance, arranged
      concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of
      disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of by pressure.
      This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior quality, extremely
      nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by the Japanese laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far West
      where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite House,
      where they made known their discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite
      House with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a
      press, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the
      fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon
      transformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten
      bread, but it was very like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished
      daily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of
      light carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the
      corral, and when it was Pencroft&rsquo;s turn to go he took Jup, and let him
      drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and
      certainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from
      their native land, had no reason to complain. They were so well suited to
      this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they could
      not have left its hospitable soil without regret!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of
      man, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the
      colonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention, and
      would have departed!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his
      companions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an
      October day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda on
      the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the darkness creeping
      up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of elder-berries, which
      took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb. They were speaking of
      the island and of its isolated situation in the Pacific, which led Gideon
      Spilett to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in
      the case, again taken the position of our island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument, which
      is more perfect than that which you before used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good?&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;The island is quite comfortable where
      it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who knows,&rdquo; returned the reporter, &ldquo;who knows but that we may be
      much nearer inhabited land than we think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and if it had not been
      for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known it
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;The captain is too good an observer to be
      mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just
      where he put it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the
      necessary observations to verify the position which he had already
      obtained, and this was the result of his operation. His first observation
      had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In west longitude: from 150 to 155;
    </p>
    <p>
      In south latitude: from 30 to 35
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The second gave exactly:
</pre>
    <p>
      In longitude: 150 30&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In south latitude: 34 57&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Harding
      had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed five
      degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;since we possess an atlas as well as a
      sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln
      Island occupies in the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and the
      engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An island?&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An important island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been
      visited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will visit it,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer
      her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and fifty miles! And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; returned Pencroft. &ldquo;In
      forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in
      time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return of
      the fine season.

    <h2>
      Chapter 10
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it was
      executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a certain
      size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the
      island? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which stands
      water as well as the elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would not
      return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work alone at
      the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to hunt, and neither
      Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the domestic duties which
      had devolved upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their
      branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able to
      do it. A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the cliff, a
      dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long, furnished
      with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as
      much about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had at
      first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably seconded
      by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard in
      Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade. It was not until after
      careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on the
      keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new
      enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from
      his dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in on
      the 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded the
      number of grains which had been predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five bushels, captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, after having scrupulously measured
      his treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five bushels,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;and a hundred and thirty thousand
      grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will sow them all this time,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;except a little
      in reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we shall
      have four thousand bushels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall we eat bread?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall eat bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must have a mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will make one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the
      soil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done,
      Pencroft returned to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and they
      ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their guns
      loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast thicket
      of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room. The
      exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in the extreme,
      and the reporter never ventured there without the pocket-compass, for the
      sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage and it would have been very
      difficult for them to retrace their way. It naturally happened that game
      was more rare in those situations where there was hardly sufficient room
      to move; two or three large herbivorous animals were however killed during
      the last fortnight of April. These were koalas, specimens of which the
      settlers had already seen to the north of the lake, and which stupidly
      allowed themselves to be killed among the thick branches of the trees in
      which they took refuge. Their skins were brought back to Granite House,
      and there, by the help of sulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of
      tanning process which rendered them capable of being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far West,
      when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in a sort of
      clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had permitted a few
      rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first surprised at the odor which
      exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks, round and branchy,
      bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small berries. The
      reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned to the lad, to
      whom he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can this be, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;this is a treasure which will secure
      you Pencroft&rsquo;s gratitude forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it tobacco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less
      tobacco!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good old Pencroft! Won&rsquo;t he be pleased! But we must not let him smoke
      it all, he must give us our share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us
      say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine
      day we will present him with a pipe already filled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have
      nothing left to wish for in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and
      then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much
      precaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of
      custom-house officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor suspected
      nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long, which was
      required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and subject them
      to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took two months; but all
      these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown to Pencroft, for,
      occupied with the construction of his boat, he only returned to Granite
      House at the hour of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles out
      in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale of the
      largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species, called
      the &ldquo;Cape Whale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!&rdquo; cried the
      sailor. &ldquo;Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would say
      &lsquo;After the beast,&rsquo; for he would be well worth the trouble of catching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pencroft,&rdquo; observed Harding, &ldquo;I should much like to watch you
      handling a harpoon. It would be very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;to see a whale in this
      comparatively high latitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, Mr. Spilett?&rdquo; replied Herbert. &ldquo;We are exactly in that part of
      the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field, and
      it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales of the
      Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of regret,
      for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of fishing is in
      exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge how a whaler
      feels in sight of a whale. And if this had only been for pleasure! But
      they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize would have been to
      the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have been put to many uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the
      waters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite
      House, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they
      were not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left the
      telescope, but watched all the animal&rsquo;s movements. The cetacean, having
      entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from Mandible
      Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes, on which
      it supported itself, and making its way through the water at the rate
      little short of twelve knots. Sometimes also it approached so near
      to the island that it could be clearly distinguished. It was the southern
      whale, which is completely black, the head being more depressed than that
      of the northern whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great height a
      cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear, naturalists
      and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is it water which
      is thus driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor, which,
      condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It
      irritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while at
      work. He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it has
      been denied. At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly if he
      had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit state to
      put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them,
      and on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the
      kitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting, left
      their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining their
      companions, all rushed towards the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles
      from Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the
      cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it was
      best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran with
      pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the Mercy
      bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach, and in
      less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous animal,
      above which flocks of birds already hovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a monster!&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty feet
      long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a hundred
      and fifty thousand pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by
      struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are whalers in these quarters, then?&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything!&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;Whales
      have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side, and
      this one might even have been struck in the north of the Atlantic and come
      to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal&rsquo;s side, read this
      inscription on it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The
      &lsquo;Maria Stella!&rsquo; A fine whaler, &lsquo;pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my
      friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!&mdash;a whaler from the Vineyard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion, the
      name which he loved so well&mdash;the name of his birthplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as it could not be expected that the &ldquo;Maria Stella&rdquo; would come to
      reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it up
      before decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched this rich
      prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it without
      further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing at them
      repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it,
      which, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass
      for cow&rsquo;s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color,
      nor density.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could
      methodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently
      disagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers did
      not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would end by
      making a &ldquo;real good castaway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness,
      then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each,
      was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did
      not wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it
      lost nearly a third of its weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six
      thousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides the
      fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine,
      there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless be found,
      although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at Granite House. The
      upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed, provided on both
      sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic, of a fibrous texture,
      and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which the teeth, six feet
      long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae, little fish, and
      molluscs, on which the whale fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the
      remains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every
      vestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed by
      the inmates of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived the
      idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the curiosity
      of his companions. He took a dozen of the whale&rsquo;s bones, cut them into six
      equal parts, and sharpened their ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed by
      the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my friends;
      well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them with water till
      they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them bent, and I will
      strew them on the snow, having previously covered them with fat. Now, what
      will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these baits? Why, the heat
      of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone, springing straight, will
      pierce him with its sharp points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I do call that ingenious!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will spare the powder and shot,&rdquo; rejoined Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be better than traps!&rdquo; added Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of the
      month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that her
      shape was excellent, and that she would sail well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could
      have borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a
      reward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of
      the greatest joys of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table,
      Pencroft felt a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn&rsquo;t sneak off like that! You&rsquo;ve
      forgotten your dessert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;I am going back to my
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pipe, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he saw
      the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert with a
      glowing coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so, seizing
      the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal, he drew five
      or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and from its depths
      a voice was heard repeating excitedly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobacco! real tobacco!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pencroft,&rdquo; returned Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and very good tobacco too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!&rdquo; cried the sailor.
      &ldquo;Nothing more is now wanting to our island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who made this discovery?&rdquo; he asked at length. &ldquo;You, Herbert, no
      doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Spilett!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping
      him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything like
      it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Pencroft,&rdquo; said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, &ldquo;a truce for
      one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized the
      plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great deal of
      trouble to keep our secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friends, I will repay you some day,&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;Now we
      are friends for life.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the
      northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid
      clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this
      precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders, combers,
      polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting machine to
      spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed in a simpler
      way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed he proposed to
      make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when
      subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing
      by this simple process the material called felt. This felt could then be
      obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of
      the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion. Now the
      wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs, and was in
      a good condition to be felted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once
      more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations, the
      subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with
      which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning was
      done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the temperature of
      seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty
      hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when
      sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that
      is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would
      have no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which
      would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times,
      and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process
      which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding&rsquo;s engineering
      qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine
      for pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the
      mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach
      possessed to move a fulling-mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and
      upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in
      question, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the
      mallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was no
      longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success. The
      wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on the one
      hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the softening of
      the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by the beating,
      issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The roughnesses
      with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly
      entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed equally
      suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly neither
      merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel. It was
      &ldquo;Lincolnian felt,&rdquo; and Lincoln Island possessed yet another manufacture.
      The colonists had now warm garments and thick bedclothes, and they could
      without fear await the approach of the winter of 1866-67.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his great
      regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which he hoped
      to finish in time for next spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor&rsquo;s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island,
      although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for curiosity&rsquo;s
      sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this desert and
      almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a comparatively
      small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him some anxiety.
      Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be unable to reach
      Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island, what would become of
      her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him
      strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he
      himself could give no sufficient reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the engineer one day to him, &ldquo;I must observe, my friend, that
      after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having
      spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to
      forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to leave it for a few days,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;only for a few days,
      captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why venture there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To know what is going on in Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you are caught in a hurricane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear of that in the fine season,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;But,
      captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your
      permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor&rsquo;s
      shoulder, &ldquo;if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom chance
      has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, &ldquo;we shall
      not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this voyage,
      when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen our
      tight-rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at sea,
      when we sail round our island, for we will do so together&mdash;I fancy, I
      say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don&rsquo;t conceal from
      you that your boat will be a masterpiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say &lsquo;our&rsquo; boat, at least, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer, disarmed for
      the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without
      convincing either the sailor or the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had
      previously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to it
      were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should never
      be allowed to pass without someone going to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried.
      The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered with a thick
      outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest at a spot
      where animals usually passed on their way to the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the engineer&rsquo;s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the
      Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild boars,
      and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being found dead,
      their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but
      because it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate with
      the rest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into
      the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps carry
      to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could
      cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island from
      any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without difficulty,
      of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert&rsquo;s gun had slightly wounded in
      the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten feet from wing to wing,
      and which could traverse seas as wide as the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would soon
      heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to him that
      they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to communicate by
      this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the albatross had
      come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but that it would
      return there so soon as it was set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes came
      to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to
      take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the
      settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized reporter of
      the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain the article,
      if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the Honorable James
      Bennett!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a
      strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it to
      forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was
      fastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these
      birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then liberty
      was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not without some
      emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the misty west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he going to?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards New Zealand,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good voyage to you,&rdquo; shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect any
      great result from this mode of correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House,
      mending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails
      for their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of
      either wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in
      the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking
      while they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed
      with profit to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted
      with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry
      coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke,
      they could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been
      complete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far from
      their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with them.
      They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had left, of
      the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could not but
      increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the affairs
      of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his views,
      and his prognostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement to
      which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of being
      sooner or later completely stopped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopped! And by what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of
      minerals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the most precious indeed,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;and it would seem
      that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond, which is
      simply pure carbon crystallized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say, captain,&rdquo; interrupted Pencroft, &ldquo;that we burn
      diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; resumed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;you do not deny that some day the coal
      will be entirely consumed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred thousand
      miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights
      have not nearly exhausted them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the increasing consumption of coal,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;it can
      be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred
      thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more
      thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for a
      long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long a time?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our
      great-grandchildren!&rdquo; observed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will discover something else,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be hoped so,&rdquo; answered Spilett, &ldquo;for without coal there would be
      no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no
      steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to
      modern civilization!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will they find?&rdquo; asked Pencroft. &ldquo;Can you guess, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will they burn instead of coal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;water as fuel for steamers and engines! water to
      heat water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,&rdquo; replied Cyrus
      Harding, &ldquo;and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have
      become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by some
      inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same time.
      Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel,
      that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together,
      will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of
      which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the
      tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two
      condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific
      power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as the earth is
      inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants, and there will be
      no want of either light or heat as long as the productions of the
      vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us. I believe, then,
      that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm
      ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see that,&rdquo; observed the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were born too soon, Pencroft,&rdquo; returned Neb, who only took part in
      the discussion by these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was not Neb&rsquo;s speech which interrupted the conversation, but
      Top&rsquo;s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which
      had before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run round
      the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can Top be barking in that way for?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jup be growling like that?&rdquo; added Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation,
      and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;that this well is in direct
      communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time to
      time to breathe at the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;and there can be no other
      explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!&rdquo; added Pencroft, turning to the
      dog, &ldquo;and you, Jup, be off to your room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained in
      the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest
      of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the
      incident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and
      frost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter, and
      its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although this
      winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls; the sea
      besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times it almost
      seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which
      thundered against the wall of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery
      masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the
      magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves
      rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the
      raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the
      spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out,
      owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never
      allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral. Happily,
      this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did
      not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes, which spared its
      trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on Prospect Heights,
      being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east, suffered
      considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling
      blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for,
      as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the most
      dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if it formed the
      central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually as the whip does
      the top, only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which
      moved. During the first week of the month of August the weather became
      more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to
      have lost forever. With the calm the cold again became intense, and the
      thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several
      days was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn
      Marsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their
      winter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there,
      and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against
      these birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part
      in this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse,
      did not join them, but remained at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to reach
      the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top and Jup
      accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy Bridge, the
      engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into execution a project
      for the performance of which he wished to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth of
      which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which
      communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the waters
      of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such strange
      barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well? Why
      did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well branches
      besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards other parts
      of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He had resolved,
      therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during the absence of
      his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope
      ladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The
      engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured
      nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely
      fastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a
      revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and
      there, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for
      an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these
      points by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no
      fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either
      recently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding
      descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw nothing suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water,
      which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other part
      of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior of the
      cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded
      solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being could force a
      way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it
      was necessary to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the
      beach, which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only
      possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where this
      channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth beneath the
      water, it could not be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the
      ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the
      diningroom, saying to himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0034" id="link2HCH0034">

    <h2>
      Chapter 12
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being
      literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could
      possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of snipe round
      his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, master,&rdquo; cried Neb; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something to employ our time! Preserved
      and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must have some one
      to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Neb,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;I have the rigging of the vessel to finish
      and to look after, and you will have to do without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Mr. Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,&rdquo; replied the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To oblige you, Neb, I will,&rdquo; replied the reporter; &ldquo;but I warn you that
      if you disclose your recipes to me, I shall publish them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied Neb; &ldquo;whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb&rsquo;s assistant and was
      installed in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made
      known to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day
      before, and on this point the reporter shared Harding&rsquo;s opinion, that
      although he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!
    </p>
    <p>
      The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave
      Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling was
      filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned
      manipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase
      were not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly in
      the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and declared
      superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the sailmaker&rsquo;s
      needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the sails of the
      vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks to the rigging
      which had been discovered with the case of the balloon, the ropes and
      cables from the net were all of good quality, and the sailor turned them
      all to account. To the sails were attached strong bolt ropes, and there
      still remained enough from which to make the halyards, shrouds, and
      sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under
      Pencroft&rsquo;s directions by means of the turning lathe. It therefore happened
      that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was finished.
      Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to every true
      American, containing the stars and stripes of their glorious Union. The
      colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing, and which
      were very abundant in the island; only to the thirty-seven stars,
      representing the thirty-seven States of the Union, which shine on the
      American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the star of &ldquo;the State of
      Lincoln,&rdquo; for he considered his island as already united to the great
      republic. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is so already in heart, if not in deed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite
      House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this
      second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the
      night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced
      with complete destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top&rsquo;s barking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at the
      threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to burst
      it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Top!&rdquo; cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued to
      bark more furiously than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim
      light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular yelping
      noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had been invaded
      by a number of animals which could not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; cried Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wolves, jaguars, or apes?&rdquo; replied Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have nearly reached the plateau,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our poultry-yard,&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert, &ldquo;and our garden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can they have crossed?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have crossed the bridge on the shore,&rdquo; replied the engineer,
      &ldquo;which one of us must have forgotten to close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;I remember having left it open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; cried the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is done cannot be undone,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;We must consult
      what it will now be best to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between
      Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been
      crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever
      they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach
      Prospect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and
      fought with if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are these beasts?&rdquo; was asked a second time, as the yelpings were
      again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert start, and
      he remembered having heard them before during his first visit to the
      sources of the Red Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are colpeo foxes!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; shouted the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw
      themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by
      hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves
      into the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up the
      darkness made their assailants draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau,
      for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at their mercy,
      and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably be the result,
      especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the invasion of the
      plateau could only be made by the left bank of the Mercy, it was
      sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and
      the cliff of granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s orders, they reached the
      spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the
      gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted
      themselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded
      the colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel, which
      he brandished like a club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the
      revolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who
      were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot
      coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must not pass!&rdquo; shouted Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall not pass!&rdquo; returned the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it. Those
      in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an incessant
      struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already lay dead on
      the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish, and it might have
      been supposed that reinforcements were continually arriving over the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without
      receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had, with
      a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had sprung
      like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the throats of
      the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded his weapon
      valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep him in the
      rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the
      obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to
      time&mdash;a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great
      rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver he was
      seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was coping with
      great coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side of
      the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The first
      signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of their
      assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the bridge,
      which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently lighted up
      the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies
      scattered about on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jup!&rdquo; cried Pencroft; &ldquo;where is Jup?&rdquo; Jup had disappeared. His friend
      Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his friend&rsquo;s
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found among
      the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow
      with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos whose
      broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the
      terrible club of the intrepid animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but
      deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest
      was covered with severe wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is living,&rdquo; cried Neb, who was bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will save him,&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;We will nurse him as if he
      was one of ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft&rsquo;s
      shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound
      was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their
      firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a
      distance. It was therefore only the orang whose condition was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a
      slight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to
      Granite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds,
      and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not appear that
      any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from loss of blood,
      and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been dressed. He was
      laid down, strict diet was imposed, &ldquo;just like a real person,&rdquo; as Neb
      said, and they made him swallow several cups of a cooling drink, for which
      the ingredients were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of Granite
      House. Jup was at first restless, but his breathing gradually became more
      regular, and he was left sleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking
      on tip-toe, as one might say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to
      approve of all the care that had been taken of him. One of Jup&rsquo;s hands
      hung over the side of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.
    </p>
    <p>
      They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the
      forest of the Far West, and there buried deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a lesson
      to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one of their
      number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that no
      invasion was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several days,
      began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever
      gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor,
      pronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to
      eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured
      with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being
      somewhat of a gourmand, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of
      this fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have?&rdquo; said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes
      expostulated with him for spoiling the ape. &ldquo;Poor Jup has no other
      pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to
      reward his services in this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup arose.
      His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not be long in
      regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all convalescents, he was
      tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he
      liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which is too often wanting in
      reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any excess. Neb was delighted to
      see his pupil&rsquo;s appetite returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat away, my Jup,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t spare anything; you have shed your
      blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of August Neb&rsquo;s voice was heard calling to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb&rsquo;s call,
      who was then in Jup&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see?
      Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk
      at the entrance to Granite House!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pipe,&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;He has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup, I
      make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great
      satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this
      incident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of
      tobacco had become quite familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor&rsquo;s ex-pipe,
      which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled it
      himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest
      of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes
      of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which
      already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is really a man,&rdquo; said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. &ldquo;Should you
      be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, no,&rdquo; replied Neb. &ldquo;What astonishes me is that he hasn&rsquo;t spoken
      to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would amuse me all the same,&rdquo; resumed the sailor, &ldquo;if some fine day he
      said to me, &lsquo;Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Neb, &ldquo;what a pity he was born dumb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again
      eagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was
      already completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull were
      firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all the
      purposes of a mold.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a
      double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them,
      approved the sailor&rsquo;s idea of making the craft as strong as possible. The
      interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the 15th of
      September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed, which was
      hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered with boiling
      tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first been
      ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime, twelve
      thousand pounds of which they stowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into two
      cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers. The
      foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two cabins,
      which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He chose
      a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to square at
      the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast, the rudder
      and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the Chimneys. Lastly,
      yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all furnished by the first
      week in October, and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round
      the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea, and how
      far they might depend upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected. The
      corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased
      by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The colonists had
      paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal and iron mines,
      and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far West forest, which
      abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were discovered, and those fit
      for immediate use contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with
      eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant with
      joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely rigged,
      having been pushed on rollers to the water&rsquo;s edge, was floated by the
      rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of Pencroft,
      who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance was to last
      beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having built her, he was
      to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon him with the
      approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now necessary to
      give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had been
      discussed, the votes were all in favor of the &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo; As soon as
      the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; had been lifted by the rising tide, it was seen that
      she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated. However, the
      trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion off the coast.
      The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially
      towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hands on board,&rdquo; shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first necessary,
      and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the event of their
      excursion being prolonged until the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which
      had originated with him, although on the sailor&rsquo;s advice he had altered
      some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft&rsquo;s confidence in her, and
      as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island, Harding
      hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance in letting
      two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a boat, which
      was not of more than fifteen tons&rsquo; burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert
      weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the
      Mercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the
      masthead, and the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her
      owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast
      pair of heels, according to Pencroft&rsquo;s mode of speaking. After having
      doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled, so
      as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found she
      sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were enchanted,
      they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service
      to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to
      be charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port
      Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new
      aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile
      End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage of
      other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty head
      was still whitened with snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful it is!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, our island is beautiful and good,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;I love it as I
      loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what is
      wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Neb; &ldquo;nothing, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their
      island!
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched
      the panorama which was developed before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Harding,&rdquo; asked Pencroft, &ldquo;what do you think of our
      vessel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She appears to behave well,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some
      extent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What voyage, Pencroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One to Tabor Island, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;I think that in any pressing emergency we
      need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; even for a
      longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island with
      great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One likes to know one&rsquo;s neighbors,&rdquo; returned the sailor, who was
      obstinate in his idea. &ldquo;Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!
      Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;our friend Pencroft has become very particular
      about the proprieties all at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not particular about anything at all,&rdquo; retorted the sailor, who was
      rather vexed by the engineer&rsquo;s opposition, but who did not wish to cause
      him anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider, Pencroft,&rdquo; resumed Harding, &ldquo;you cannot go alone to Tabor
      Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One companion will be enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;you will risk depriving the colony of
      Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of six,&rdquo; answered Pencroft; &ldquo;you forget Jup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of seven,&rdquo; added Neb; &ldquo;Top is quite worth another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no risk at all in it, captain,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves
      uselessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite
      determined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident
      would come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was at
      first only a doubtful whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After standing off the shore the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; again approached it in the
      direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the channels
      between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down since this
      little creek was to be the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary
      to tack to beat against the wind. The &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was then going at a
      very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land,
      scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled
      now and then by passing gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the
      course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luff, Pencroft, luff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;a rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;wait,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see. Luff again&mdash;right&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the water,
      and pulled it out, exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bottle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few cables&rsquo; 
      length from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew the
      cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castaway.... Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11&rsquo; S. lat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0035" id="link2HCH0035">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>
    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      Chapter 13
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A castaway!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft; &ldquo;left on this Tabor Island not two
      hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won&rsquo;t now oppose my
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding; &ldquo;and you shall set out as soon as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the
      bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded, we
      may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man
      possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the
      latitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it, and
      to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or
      American, as the document is written in the English language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perfectly logical,&rdquo; answered Spilett; &ldquo;and the presence of this
      castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.
      There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the latter,
      whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of building
      this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and this bottle
      might have been broken on the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;it is a fortunate chance that the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; 
      passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not this appear strange to you?&rdquo; asked Harding of Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears fortunate, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;Do you see
      anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and
      why not here as well as anywhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Herbert, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to prove that this bottle has
      been floating long in the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and the document appears even to have
      been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put
      the vessel about, and the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; all sails set, was running
      rapidly towards Claw Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they be in
      time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the colonists!
      They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared that another
      might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go to his succor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o&rsquo;clock the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; dropped
      her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made. It
      appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the vessel,
      should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day, the 10th
      of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present wind it
      would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage of a
      hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to return,
      they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach Lincoln
      Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising, the wind appeared
      settled, everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of
      humanity was taking far from their island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett should
      remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and Spilett, who had
      not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York Herald, having
      declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an
      opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was occupied in transporting on board the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo;
       articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions for
      a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the farewells were said, not
      without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made towards
      Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when the
      passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving their
      farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friends,&rdquo; exclaimed Spilett, &ldquo;this is our first separation in fifteen
      months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House soon
      disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first part of the day the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was still in sight of
      the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like a
      green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights,
      diminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt
      vessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though at
      a distance of about ten miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of the
      Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin, and
      three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she
      proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and
      steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to
      time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad&rsquo;s hand was so firm that
      the sailor had not a point to find fault with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if
      wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly
      satisfied with his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first quarter
      until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The night was
      dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by a
      sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an unnecessary
      precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent sailor and
      cannot be blamed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns for
      a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as he
      would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and
      judgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to
      his steersman, and Herbert never allowed the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; to swerve even
      a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of October.
      A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly
      within sight of Tabor Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely
      deserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within
      gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he had
      confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These birds
      were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the ocean
      between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; observed Herbert, &ldquo;this is the time that whalers usually
      proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think
      there could be a more deserted sea than this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not quite so deserted as all that,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroft laughed at his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles
      since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six
      hours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots.
      The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether. However,
      it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the calculation had
      been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the
      expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion. There
      was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor Island?
      Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had
      come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the little colony
      till then so united? Besides, would he be content to exchange his prison
      for another? All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the
      next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed
      their gaze on the western horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; shouted Pencroft at about six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was evident
      that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo; In a few hours they would land on the beach of the island!
    </p>
    <p>
      The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not
      more than fifteen miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; which was a little to the south of the
      island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east,
      its rays fell upon one or two headlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,&rdquo; observed
      Herbert, &ldquo;and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was not more than two miles off, and
      Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land, proceeded
      very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the island could
      now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum and other large
      trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln Island. But the
      astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that the island was
      inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this
      castaway should have been on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; entered the winding channels among the
      reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had put
      Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the water,
      while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the shore,
      though without perceiving anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at about twelve o&rsquo;clock the keel of the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; grated on
      the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of the
      little vessel landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since
      according to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of
      the Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of her
      being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his companions,
      well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation of about two
      hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a
      mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the summit of that hill,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;we can no doubt obtain a
      complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as to do here,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;that which Captain Harding did the
      very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;and it is the best plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing which
      terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and
      sea-swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them.
      Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the
      bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence of
      timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it
      in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in
      circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories, bays
      or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea extended to
      the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid
      and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the contrary
      this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills
      of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream
      through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The domain is limited,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Pencroft: &ldquo;It would have been too small for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And moreover,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;it appears to be uninhabited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;nothing here betrays the presence of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go down,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;and search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place
      where they had left the &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before exploring
      the interior; so that not a spot should escape their investigations. The
      beach was easy to follow, and only in some places was their way barred by
      large rocks, which, however, they easily passed round. The explorers
      proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and
      herds of seals, which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw
      the strangers at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those beasts yonder,&rdquo; observed the reporter, &ldquo;do not see men for the
      first time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the
      islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along
      the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background
      bordered with thick woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a
      human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours&rsquo; walking had
      been gone completely round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to
      believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps,
      after all the document was already several months or several years old,
      and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been
      enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable conjectures,
      dined rapidly on board the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; so as to be able to continue
      their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening, at which hour they entered the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might say,
      only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had
      rapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take
      them back to Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited
      this islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden
      through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the hand of
      man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled many years
      ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the grass grew long
      and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;this not only proves that men have landed
      on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now, who were
      these men? How many of them remain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The document,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;only spoke of one castaway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he is still on the island,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;it is impossible
      but that we shall find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally
      followed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were
      thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed
      incontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens
      of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the
      midst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with
      culinary plants, at probably the same distant period.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, was Herbert&rsquo;s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory,
      sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to
      collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, jolly!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft. &ldquo;That will suit Neb as well as us.
      Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have
      been useless, and God will have rewarded us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but to see the state in which we
      find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been
      inhabited for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not have
      neglected such an important culture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;the castaway has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated
      in the sea a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; returned Pencroft. &ldquo;But night is coming on,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and I
      think that it will be best to give up the search for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,&rdquo; said the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when Herbert,
      pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was
      just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick
      tarpaulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a rapid
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hut was empty!

    <h2>
      Chapter 14
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft shouted loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for a
      minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was a
      rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry wood.
      Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave forth a
      bright light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of
      which the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for a
      long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered with
      rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor&rsquo;s
      clothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a
      corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which was
      broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still
      untouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly
      covered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one here,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time since this room has been inhabited,&rdquo; observed Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a very long time!&rdquo; answered the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; then said Pencroft, &ldquo;instead of returning on board, I think
      that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and if its owner
      returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken
      possession of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not return,&rdquo; said the sailor, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that he has quitted the island?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and his
      tools,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;You know the value which castaways set on such
      articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!&rdquo; repeated the
      sailor, in a tone of conviction; &ldquo;no, he has not left the island! If he
      had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left these
      indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself,
      and so we shall at least find his remains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted
      dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm it.
      The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there, seated on a
      bench, talking little but wondering much. They were in a frame of mind to
      imagine anything or expect anything. They listened eagerly for sounds
      outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and a man presented himself
      to them without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding all
      that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands ready to
      press the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown friend, for whom
      friends were waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert
      alone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They were
      all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before, and to
      search the most secret recesses of the islet! The inferences deduced by
      Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain that, as the
      hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were still there,
      the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that they should search
      for his remains, and give them at least Christian burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey
      the dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation, at the
      back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent gum-trees.
      Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared a wide
      clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a lawn,
      surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on the left
      of which was the mouth of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these planks
      had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was probable that a
      disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the island, that one at
      least of the crew had been saved, and that by means of the wreck this man,
      having tools at his disposal, had built the dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having
      walked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which had
      formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half
      effaced:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              BR&mdash;TAN&mdash;A
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Britannia,&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; &ldquo;it is a
      common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or
      American!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters very little, Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little indeed,&rdquo; answered the sailor, &ldquo;and we will save the survivor
      of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may belong. But
      before beginning our search again let us go on board the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel.
      Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken
      possession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable
      supposition. At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on
      board. The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile. They set
      out on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats
      and pigs fled in hundreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached
      the western coast of the island, and saw the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; held fast by
      her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this vessel
      was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy when
      there is no occasion for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary to
      dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration was
      continued and conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was very
      probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished. It was
      therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that Pencroft
      and his companions searched. But their searches were vain, and during the
      half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets of trees
      which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the
      castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild
      beast had probably devoured it to the last bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will set off to-morrow at daybreak,&rdquo; said Pencroft to his two
      companions, as about two o&rsquo;clock they were resting for a few minutes under
      the shade of a clump of firs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which
      belonged to the castaway,&rdquo; added Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; returned Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and these arms and tools will
      make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot is also
      most important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;but we must not forget to capture a couple or
      two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to gather those seeds,&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;which will give us all the
      vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps it would be best,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;to remain a day
      longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;I will ask you to set off to-morrow
      at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the west, and
      after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair wind for
      going back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do not let us lose time,&rdquo; said Herbert, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t waste time,&rdquo; returned Pencroft. &ldquo;You, Herbert, go and gather the
      seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that, Mr. Spilett
      and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope we shall
      manage to catch a few!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part of
      the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals,
      which were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow
      themselves to be approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after an hour&rsquo;s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold
      of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from the
      north part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible yells, in
      which there was nothing human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs by
      this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was getting
      ready the rope to bind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Herbert&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot
      from whence the cries proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they
      saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being,
      apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch
      Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for
      Pencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the
      reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster&rsquo;s resistance he
      was firmly tied so that he could not even move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not hurt, Herbert?&rdquo; asked Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if this ape had wounded him!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is not an ape,&rdquo; answered Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being
      who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being, a
      man. But what a man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the word,
      and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree
      of brutishness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost
      naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with
      immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if made
      of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be called
      a man. But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in this body,
      or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?&rdquo;
       said Pencroft to the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! there is no doubt about it,&rdquo; replied Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this must be the castaway?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but the unfortunate man has no longer
      anything human about him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had ever
      been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse, perhaps
      a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat between
      his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he had
      forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to make
      a fire! It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the physical
      qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral qualities.
      Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did not appear to understand or even to
      hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought he could see
      that all reason was not extinguished in him. However, the prisoner did not
      struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he overwhelmed by the
      presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he found in some corner
      of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled him to humanity? If
      free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain? They could not tell,
      but they did not make the experiment; and after gazing attentively at the
      miserable creature,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever he may be,&rdquo; remarked Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;whoever he may have been,
      and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to Lincoln
      Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;and perhaps with care we may arouse in him
      some gleam of intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soul does not die,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and it would be a great
      satisfaction to rescue one of God&rsquo;s creatures from brutishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try at any rate,&rdquo; returned the reporter; &ldquo;humanity commands us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three
      felt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their
      acting thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we leave him bound?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cords which shackled the prisoner&rsquo;s feet were cut off, but his arms
      remained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest any
      desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three
      men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected being
      their fellow, or at least having been so. A continual hissing sound issued
      from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the reporter&rsquo;s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut. Perhaps
      the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some impression on
      him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his obscured intellect,
      to rekindle his dulled soul. The dwelling was not far off. In a few
      minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner remembered nothing, and it
      appeared that he had lost consciousness of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this
      miserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet
      dated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a rational
      being solitude had reduced him to this condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have some
      effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that attract
      even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame seemed at
      first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon he turned away
      and the look of intelligence faded. Evidently there was nothing to be
      done, for the time at least, but to take him on board the &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo;
       This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft&rsquo;s charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after
      they came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of
      vegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was embarked, and the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was ready to weigh anchor and
      sail with the morning tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet,
      silent, apparently deaf and dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked meat
      that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But on the
      sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he pounced
      on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that he will recover his senses?&rdquo; asked Pencroft. &ldquo;It is not
      impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is solitude
      that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he will be no
      longer alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,&rdquo; said
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what age is he?&rdquo; asked the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to say,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;for it is impossible to
      see his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is no
      longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?&rdquo; asked
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could
      expect from his appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, we shall see,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and I am anxious to know what
      opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look for a
      human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we did what
      we could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be
      known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not move. He
      was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its capture, and
      becomes wild again afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather
      predicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest
      favored the return of the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; but at the same time it
      freshened, which might render navigation more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a
      reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail
      straight for Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner
      remained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it appeared
      that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction.
      Did some recollection of his former calling return to him? However that
      might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north, consequently
      in a less favorable direction for the &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo; Pencroft was soon
      obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying anything about it he
      began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which frequently broke over
      the bows. Certainly, if the wind did not moderate, it would take a longer
      time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to make Tabor Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; had been
      forty-eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the island.
      It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed, or to
      trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been very
      irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was right
      ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close-reefed, and they tacked
      frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo;;
      and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing themselves to the
      deck, they would have been carried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with
      loosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who emerged
      from the hatchway as if his sailor&rsquo;s instinct had suddenly returned, broke
      a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which
      filled the deck escape. Then the vessel being clear, he descended to his
      cabin without having uttered a word. Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and
      Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear that
      he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering his
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the wind fell,
      the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored less,
      greatly increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour&rsquo;s sleep.
      They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far
      distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; carried
      away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to
      rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree, yet did not
      despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller he anxiously
      endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o&rsquo;clock in the morning he started forward,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A light! a light!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln
      Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding,
      showed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too much
      to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire, which
      burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first magnitude.

      Chapter 15
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, after
      a voyage of four days, the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; gently glided up to the beach at
      the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and
      the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of the
      vessel which had been so long in returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised! there they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his
      hands and shouting, &ldquo;Oh! my master!&rdquo; A more touching pantomime than the
      finest discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor
      Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his
      island and change one prison for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on the
      beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand, Harding
      said: &ldquo;We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did you meet
      with any accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett; &ldquo;on the contrary, everything went
      wonderfully well. We will tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; returned the engineer, &ldquo;your search has been unsuccessful,
      since you are only three, just as you went!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;we are four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found the castaway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have brought him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;or rather he was a man! There, Cyrus, that
      is all we can tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage,
      and under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only
      dwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway had
      been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human species.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just the point,&rdquo; added Pencroft, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we have done
      right to bring him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you have, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wretched creature has no sense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is possible at present,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;but only a few
      months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who knows
      what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this
      island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be
      believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you have found
      this poor creature in such a state!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, captain,&rdquo; asked Herbert, &ldquo;what leads you to think that the
      brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the document we found had been recently written,&rdquo; answered the
      engineer, &ldquo;and the castaway alone can have written it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always supposing,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;that it had not been written
      by a companion of this man, since dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible, my dear Spilett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways,&rdquo; replied
      Harding, &ldquo;and it mentioned only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and dwelt
      on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner&rsquo;s mind,
      when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Herbert,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;you are right to attach great
      importance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and
      despair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men, and
      since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and the
      great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he
      occupied in the fore part of the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo;; when once on land he
      manifested a wish to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a
      gesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness.
      Immediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually
      became calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance
      this miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and yet
      Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an indefinable
      trace of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was
      thenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms of
      Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape. He was led there
      without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps, be
      hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in Lincoln
      Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare, as the
      reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in detail all
      the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to the islet. He
      agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger must be either
      English or American, the name Britannia leading them to suppose this, and,
      besides, through the bushy beard, and under the shaggy, matted hair, the
      engineer thought he could recognize the characteristic features of the
      Anglo-Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by the bye,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, &ldquo;you never
      told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you
      would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to
      help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;it is rather difficult to say how it
      happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard a
      noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely had time
      to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt concealed in a
      tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you about it, and
      unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;you ran a great danger, but, perhaps,
      without that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from your
      search, and we should not have had a new companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?&rdquo; asked the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and returned
      to the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools, saw
      nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very
      profitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where
      they soon became at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box of
      caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small
      powder-magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern,
      where there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle
      was to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there
      was no reason for substituting ordinary powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the unloading of the vessel was finished,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;I think it would be prudent to put our
      &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; in a safe place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;Half of the time she is stranded on
      the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she
      behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could she not float in the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the
      east winds, I think that the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; would suffer much from the
      surf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Port Balloon,&rdquo; replied the sailor. &ldquo;That little creek, shut in by
      rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not rather far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a
      fine straight road to take us there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it then, Pencroft, and take your &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; there,&rdquo; replied the
      engineer, &ldquo;and yet I would rather have her under our more immediate
      protection. When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Famous!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft. &ldquo;A harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and
      dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my brave Pencroft,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;but on condition,
      however, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; the
      anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly
      towards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil
      waters of Port Balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he
      already given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming
      tamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In
      short, was the soul returning to the body?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the
      reporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been
      totally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open air, to the
      unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger
      manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw himself
      onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House. But gradually
      he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his
      carnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment
      than that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce in
      him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo; Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was
      sleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of mane
      and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more suitably,
      after having got rid of the rag which covered him. The result was that,
      thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more human appearance,
      and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder. Certainly, when
      formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man&rsquo;s face must have had a sort
      of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours in
      his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in
      different things, so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be
      sufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain to
      recall reason. That had been seen, during the storm, on board the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure!&rdquo; The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so as
      to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the
      depths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions,
      sometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of
      things belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said, and
      the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them. Sometimes
      the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a proof that he
      suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken; but he did not
      speak, although at different times, however, they almost thought that
      words were about to issue from his lips. At all events, the poor creature
      was quite quiet and sad!
    </p>
    <p>
      But was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result of
      his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain
      objects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists, to
      whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy, better
      fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature should
      gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new life? or
      rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable to him, was he
      not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his master? This was an
      important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious to answer, and yet he
      did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would he ever be a
      convalescent?
    </p>
    <p>
      How the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for
      his soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it! The
      settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure undertaken
      by Harding. They aided him also in this work of humanity, and all, except
      perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope and his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed a
      sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently felt.
      Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him to another
      scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been accustomed to
      contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might perhaps recall those
      where so many years of his life had been passed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;can we hope that he will not escape, if once
      set at liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The experiment must be tried,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;When that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh
      air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; returned Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try,&rdquo; said Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will try,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor
      Island had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was warm,
      and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and Pencroft
      went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying near the
      window and gazing at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my friend,&rdquo; said the engineer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and
      he followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident as
      to the result of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in the
      lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before
      Granite House. The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united on
      the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him
      at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with
      extreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape. He
      was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on the
      sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is only the sea,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and possibly it does not
      inspire him with any wish to escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;we must take him to the plateau, on the border of
      the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, he could not run away,&rdquo; said Neb, &ldquo;since the bridge is raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t a man to be troubled by a stream like
      Creek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes not
      quitting those of his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing
      the left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest,
      their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger appeared
      greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere, and
      a long sigh escaped from his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement
      to escape!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the
      creek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an
      instant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half
      sank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;you have become a man again, for you can
      weep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0038" id="link2HCH0038">

    <h2>
      Chapter 16
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had flashed
      across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s expression, by those tears he
      was once more a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew
      themselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but he
      did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought him
      back to Granite House. Two days after this occurrence, the stranger
      appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life. He evidently
      heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely determined
      not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft, listening at the
      door of his room, heard these words escape from his lips:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! here! I! never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor reported these words to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some painful mystery there!&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the
      garden. When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained
      retired within himself, but on the engineer&rsquo;s recommendation, they
      respected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the
      settlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs, as
      if overburdened!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe
      so, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious to
      be told!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They must be patient and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the
      plateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding,
      who was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again
      flowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the
      unfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having endeavored
      to take his hand, he drew back quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Harding in a firmer voice, &ldquo;look at me, I wish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power, as
      a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away. But
      then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes
      flashed. Words struggled to escape from his lips. He could no longer
      contain himself! At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Who
      are you?&rdquo; he asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castaways, like you,&rdquo; replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep. &ldquo;We
      have brought you here, among your fellow-men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fellow-men!.... I have none!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in the midst of friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends!&mdash;for me! friends!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face
      in his hands. &ldquo;No&mdash;never&mdash;leave me! leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and
      remained there a long time motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! there is some mystery in that man&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and
      it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of remorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of a man we have brought here,&rdquo; said the sailor.
      &ldquo;He has secrets&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which we will respect,&rdquo; interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. &ldquo;If he has
      committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes he
      is absolved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under
      the influence of recollections which recalled all his past life&mdash;a
      melancholy life doubtless&mdash;and the colonists, without losing sight of
      him, did not attempt to disturb his solitude. However, after two hours,
      appearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding. His
      eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer. His
      countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous,
      ashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to Harding, &ldquo;your companions and you, are you English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;we are Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the stranger, and he murmured, &ldquo;I prefer that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my friend?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English,&rdquo; replied he hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the
      beach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of
      the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled
      voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What month?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;December,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1866.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years! twelve years!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he left him abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had been
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This unfortunate man,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;was no longer acquainted
      with either months or years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;and he had been twelve years already on the islet
      when we found him there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years!&rdquo; rejoined Harding. &ldquo;Ah! twelve years of solitude, after a
      wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man&rsquo;s reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am induced to think,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;that this man was not wrecked on
      Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be right, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;and if it is so it
      is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to
      fetch him some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they will no longer find him,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; added Pencroft, &ldquo;they must return, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;do not let us discuss this question
      until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has suffered,
      that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may have been, and
      that the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let us press him to
      tell us his history! He will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it,
      we shall see what course it will be best to follow. He alone besides can
      tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day to
      his country, but I doubt it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a
      certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would
      not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that
      he was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see
      his fellow-creatures again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed the sailor, &ldquo;there is one thing which I cannot explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may well
      suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in which
      we found him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probable,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must then be many years since he wrote that document!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; and yet the document appears to have been recently written!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document may
      not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not absolutely impossible,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;for it was still floating. We could not even
      suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it
      would have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks,
      and it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued the sailor, &ldquo;if the document was several years old,
      if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would have
      been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was found
      in a perfect state of preservation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor&rsquo;s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an incomprehensible
      fact, for the document appeared to have been recently written, when the
      colonists found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave the latitude and
      longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that its author had a
      more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be expected of a common
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is in this, again, something unaccountable,&rdquo; said the engineer,
      &ldquo;but we will not urge our companion to speak. When he likes, my friends,
      then we shall be ready to hear him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not
      once leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing a
      moment, without taking a minute&rsquo;s rest, but always in a retired place. At
      meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several times
      to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables. At
      nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained
      under some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some
      cleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no
      other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion to
      induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists waited
      patiently. And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost involuntarily
      urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of November, about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, as night was
      coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers, who
      were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he had
      quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome
      by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person in a
      fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his fellow-creatures
      insupportable to him? Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of
      existence? Was he pining for his former savage life? It appeared so, as
      soon he was heard to express himself in these incoherent sentences:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....
      Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know
      who I am&mdash;what I have done&mdash;why I was there&mdash;alone? And who
      told you that I was not abandoned there&mdash;that I was not condemned to
      die there?.... Do you know my past?.... How do you know that I have not
      stolen, murdered&mdash;that I am not a wretch&mdash;an accursed being&mdash;only
      fit to live like a wild beast, far from all&mdash;speak&mdash;do you know
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from
      whom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself.
      Harding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;one word only&mdash;am I free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free,&rdquo; answered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, then!&rdquo; he cried, and fled like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood&mdash;but
      they returned alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must let him alone!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will never come back!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come back,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many days passed; but Harding&mdash;was it a sort of presentiment?&mdash;persisted
      in the fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy man would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the last revolt of his wild nature,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which remorse has
      touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect
      Heights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is
      unnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor Island had
      been carefully sown. The plateau thus formed one immense kitchen-garden,
      well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of the settlers were
      never in want of work. There was always something to be done. As the
      esculents increased in number, it became necessary to enlarge the simple
      beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace the
      meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the island, and there was no
      fear of the onagers being obliged to go on short allowance. It was well
      worth while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a kitchen-garden,
      defended by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove them to the meadows,
      which had no need of protection against the depredations of quadrumana and
      quadrapeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How
      wonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months ago,
      when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop of six hundred
      thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or five hundred
      millions of grains!
    </p>
    <p>
      The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for
      sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and
      beasts. The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month of
      November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man. In
      fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill was
      necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which flowed
      into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first being already
      occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some consultation, it
      was decided that a simple windmill should be built on Prospect Heights.
      The building of this presented no more difficulty than the building of the
      former, and it was moreover certain that there would be no want of wind on
      the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to mention,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;that the windmill will be more lively
      and will have a good effect in the landscape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the
      mill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily
      transformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case
      of the balloon furnished the necessary material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a little
      to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake. The frame
      was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it could
      turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind required
      it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become very skilful
      carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models provided by the
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a pointed
      roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the sails had
      been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain angle with
      it, and secured with iron clamps. As to the different parts of the
      internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two millstones, the
      fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of large square
      trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would allow the grain
      to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to regulate the
      passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which by the
      operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour, were made without
      difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not difficult, for in
      reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This was only a question
      of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st of
      December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his work,
      and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a good wind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we shall grind our first harvest
      splendidly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good wind, certainly,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;but not too much,
      Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need for it to go so very fast,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;It
      is known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed by
      a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six times
      the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate breeze,
      which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give sixteen turns
      to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; cried Herbert, &ldquo;a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast,
      which will soon do our business for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the
      settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island.
      On this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next
      day at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although
      raised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House. Every one
      munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon
      Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite
      House, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They became seriously
      uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the former savage of Tabor
      island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest, abounding in
      game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his habits, and that
      this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts? However, Harding, by
      a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted in saying that the
      fugitive would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he will return!&rdquo; he repeated with a confidence which his companions
      could not share. &ldquo;When this unfortunate man was on Tabor Island, he knew
      himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men are awaiting him!
      Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor penitent will
      return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The event justified Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s predictions. On the 3rd of December,
      Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the
      lake. He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for
      defense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while
      Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda, the
      store of soap being exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly cries resounded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not
      been able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard
      in all haste, rushed towards the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had
      suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the
      forest, and bounded up the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the one
      which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was standing
      with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself together
      was about to spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the
      formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and
      activity. He seized the jaguar&rsquo;s throat with one powerful hand, holding it
      as in a vise, without heeding the beast&rsquo;s claws which tore his flesh, and
      with the other he plunged his knife into its heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to fly
      at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but
      Herbert, clinging to him, cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! you shall not go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him
      approaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt, but
      he took no notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;we have just contracted a debt of
      gratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life!&rdquo; murmured the stranger. &ldquo;What is that worth? Less than nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him, the
      stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and he
      appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself, and
      in an abrupt tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and what do you claim to be to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the colonists&rsquo; history which he thus demanded, and for the first
      time. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words Harding related all that had happened since their departure
      from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they now had at
      their disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger listened with extreme attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,
      Pencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they
      had felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the
      vessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them a
      new companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the stranger&rsquo;s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast,
      and confusion was depicted on his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that you know us,&rdquo; added Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;will you give us your
      hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the stranger in a hoarse voice; &ldquo;no! You are honest men! And
      I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0039" id="link2HCH0039">

    <h2>
      Chapter 17
    </h2>
    <p>
      These last words justified the colonists&rsquo; presentiment. There had been
      some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which
      his conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt
      remorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed the
      hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend it to
      honest men! However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not return to
      the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure of Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of it?
      Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret should
      never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if they
      suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon
      Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists.
      The reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for it
      would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the
      forest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard. As to Neb and
      Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the corral,
      without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want of
      employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never
      appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never
      mingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the society of those
      who had saved him was insupportable to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; observed Pencroft, &ldquo;why did he entreat the help of his
      fellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell us why,&rdquo; invariably replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, the day of confession was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, Harding
      saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble tone, said
      to him: &ldquo;Sir, I have a request to make of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;but first let me ask you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of withdrawing.
      Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of the guilty man,
      who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate him on his past
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comrade,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are not only your companions but your friends. I
      wish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a sort of
      trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to articulate a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I have come to beg you to grant me a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated
      animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to live
      there with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a
      feeling of deep commiseration; then,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the corral has only stables hardly fit for
      animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be good enough for me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;we will not constrain you in anything. You
      wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always welcome
      at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral we will make
      the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably established there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, I shall do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this
      cordial appellation, &ldquo;you must let us judge what it will be best to do in
      this respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied the stranger as he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been
      made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at
      the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary
      tools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive its
      tenant. It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from there it
      was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered more than
      eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and chest were
      manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried to the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he had
      allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied himself
      on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke to his
      work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready to be
      sowed when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral
      were completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling
      was ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and
      sleep there that very evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite
      House. It was then eight o&rsquo;clock, the hour at which their companion was to
      leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus
      imposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be
      painful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light
      knock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered, and
      without any preamble,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;before I leave you, it is right that you should
      know my history. I will tell it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his companions.
      The engineer rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ask you nothing, my friend,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is your right to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready to hear you,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the
      shade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it was in
      this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one who obliges
      himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his auditors did
      not once interrupt:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch
      nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western
      coast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On board this yacht
      were Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French
      geographer, a young girl, and a young boy. These two last were the
      children of Captain Grant, whose ship, the &lsquo;Britannia,&rsquo; had been lost,
      crew and cargo, a year before. The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; was commanded by Captain John
      Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of Australia.
      Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in English,
      German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked up by the
      &lsquo;Duncan.&rsquo; This document stated in substance that there still existed three
      survivors from the wreck of the &lsquo;Britannia,&rsquo; that these survivors were
      Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found refuge on some
      land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of which the longitude,
      effaced by the sea, was no longer legible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This latitude was 37deg 11&rsquo; south; therefore, the longitude being
      unknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents and
      seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain Grant
      and his two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to
      undertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to
      find the captain. He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined
      him. The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which the
      nobleman&rsquo;s family and the captain&rsquo;s children wished to take part, and the
      &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic, passed through
      the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as far as Patagonia,
      where, according to a previous interpretation of the document, they
      supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; disembarked her passengers on the western coast of
      Patagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at Cape
      Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the
      thirty-seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he
      re-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through
      the Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d&rsquo;Acunha and
      Amsterdam, situated in her course, the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; as I have said, arrived
      at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December,
      1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s intention to traverse Australia as he had
      traversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was
      established a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to
      the travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause which
      had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a
      three-masted English vessel, the &lsquo;Britannia,&rsquo; had been lost less than two
      years before on the west coast of Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise of
      the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is
      living on the Australian shores.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; asked Lord Glenarvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,&rsquo; replied the man; &lsquo;I am one of
      Captain Grant&rsquo;s crew&mdash;one of the castaways of the &ldquo;Britannia.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain&rsquo;s mate of the
      &lsquo;Britannia,&rsquo; as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant at
      the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then believed
      that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he, Ayrton, was
      the sole survivor of the &lsquo;Britannia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Only,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast of
      Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still living,
      as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives, and it is
      on the other coast that he must be looked for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words
      could not be doubted. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for more
      than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan, therefore,
      believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice, resolved to cross
      Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his
      wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles, and a
      few sailors composed the little band under the command of Ayrton, while
      the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded to
      Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the
      boatswain&rsquo;s mate of the &lsquo;Britannia,&rsquo; but, after some dispute with his
      captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship,
      and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the west
      coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only just.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo;;
      he had just heard of it from Glenarvan&rsquo;s account. Since his abandonment,
      he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of the escaped
      convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had taken place on
      the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it
      was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; and
      make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he
      continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was inevitably
      unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be called, guided it,
      sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of convicts, who had
      been told what they had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It was
      necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne and
      go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize her.
      After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the midst of
      vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which he was
      charged to carry to the mate of the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;&mdash;a letter which ordered
      the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is
      to say a few days&rsquo; journey from the place where the expedition had
      stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his accomplices, and
      two days after gaining possession of the letter, he arrived at Melbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able
      to take the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the
      convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become
      master of the seas. But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of
      these terrible projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom
      Austin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton&rsquo;s rage
      and disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking
      the vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to the
      east coast of New Zealand. He wished to stop him, but Austin showed him
      the letter!... And indeed, by a providential error of the French
      geographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand was
      mentioned as the place of destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Ayrton&rsquo;s plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put him in
      irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing what
      would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord Glenarvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March. On that
      day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; were being
      fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had
      accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at
      Twofold Bay. &lsquo;No &ldquo;Duncan!&rsquo; He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered,
      &ldquo;Duncan&rdquo; sailed on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest yacht
      had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate vessel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous
      man. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New
      Zealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without finding
      any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his great surprise,
      and by the will of Heaven, he found the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; under command of the
      mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the
      &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman, who
      wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain Grant.
      Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at the first
      port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English authorities.
      Ayrton remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel. In
      the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of the
      ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he
      could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island
      in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities. Lord
      Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about Captain
      Grant, consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew nothing
      from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the Australian
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The
      &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there
      that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a veritable
      miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the
      thirty-seventh parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and at
      the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord
      Glenarvan:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible
      communication with your fellow-creatures. You cannot escape from this
      islet on which the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye
      of a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither lost
      nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be remembered
      by men, men will remember you. I know where you are Ayrton, and I know
      where to find you. I will never forget it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of March,
      1855.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (The events which have just been briefly related are taken
     from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read,
     and which is entitled, &ldquo;Captain Grant&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; They will
     remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy
     in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the
     real dates were not at first given.)
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons,
      tools, or seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his, the convict&rsquo;s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain
      Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had
      committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very
      miserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to take him from
      that islet, he must be worthy to return among them! How he suffered, that
      wretched man! How he labored to recover himself by work! How he prayed to
      be reformed by prayer! For two years, three years, this went on, but
      Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship to appear on the
      horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would soon be complete,
      suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was this solitude, to a
      heart tormented by remorse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man, for
      he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that brutishness
      was gradually gaining on him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at
      last he became the miserable creature you found!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I, are
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It is
      impossible to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and
      despair lay revealed before them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton,&rdquo; said Harding, rising, &ldquo;you have been a great criminal, but
      Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That has
      been proved by your having been brought again among your fellow-creatures.
      Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my hand!&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears
      fell from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you live with us?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding, leave me some time longer,&rdquo; replied Ayrton, &ldquo;leave me
      alone in the hut in the corral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like, Ayrton,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to
      withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone, why
      did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A document?&rdquo; repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the
      exact position of Tabor Island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, &ldquo;I never
      threw any document into the sea!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned, having
      seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come back,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, captain,&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;what does that mean? What!
      wasn&rsquo;t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was he,&rdquo; answered Neb, &ldquo;only the unhappy man was half-mad.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;and he was no longer conscious of what he was

      &ldquo;It can only be explained in that way, my friends,&rdquo; replied Harding
      quickly, &ldquo;and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly
      the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his
      being left on the island had made it known to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; observed Pencroft, &ldquo;if he was not yet a brute when he wrote
      that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago,
      how is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That proves,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;that Ayrton was deprived of
      intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it must be so,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;without that the fact would
      be unaccountable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unaccountable indeed,&rdquo; answered the engineer, who did not appear desirous
      to prolong the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has Ayrton told the truth?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;The story which he has told is true in every
      point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the yacht
      expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton has told the truth,&rdquo; added Harding. &ldquo;Do not doubt it, Pencroft,
      for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse
      themselves like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day&mdash;the 21st of December&mdash;the colonists descended to
      the beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He
      had reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers
      judged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time would doubtless
      perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this day
      the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at the
      Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear Cyrus,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;that the explanation
      you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at
      all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write
      that document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the
      slightest recollection of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think nothing, I know nothing!&rdquo; interrupted Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;I am
      content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to
      explain to this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Cyrus,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;these things are incredible! Your rescue,
      the case stranded on the sand, Top&rsquo;s adventure, and lastly this bottle...
      Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied the engineer quickly, &ldquo;yes, even if I have to penetrate
      into the bowels of this island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in
      mysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable
      which has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the
      meantime we must work and observe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer
      occupations were assiduously continued. During the days which followed,
      Herbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral,
      ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which had
      been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous flock confided
      to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming every two or
      three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton
      in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid him a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions
      entertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of the
      island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that Ayrton,
      if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to inform the
      inhabitants of Granite House of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would be
      necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer&rsquo;s knowledge. Independently of
      facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others might happen,
      which would call for the prompt interference of the colonists,&mdash;such
      as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western coast, the possible
      arrival of pirates, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous
      communication with Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?&rdquo; asked Pencroft. &ldquo;Do you
      by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; answered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Electric?&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Electric,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;We have all the necessary materials
      for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch the
      wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after that,&rdquo; returned the sailor, &ldquo;I shall never despair of seeing
      ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if
      they failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and
      other accessories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality,
      and consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by
      manufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced with
      conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring the wire
      to the wished-for tenacity. This piece of steel, after having been
      tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid framework
      planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall, the motive
      power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact as the
      fulling-mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved with
      extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round
      itself. It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The iron,
      prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were sharpened
      with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of the
      drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself, to a
      length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same
      operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size.
      Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long, which
      could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance of five
      miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed as
      soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his companions
      to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with
      manufacturing his battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is known
      that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of retort
      coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the engineer,
      who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able to find any
      trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to do without it.
      Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which is found in the
      retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has been dehydrogenized,
      could have been obtained, but it would have been necessary to establish a
      special apparatus, involving great labor. As to zinc, it may be remembered
      that the case found at Flotsam Point was lined with this metal, which
      could not be better utilized than for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a very
      simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented by
      Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed. The other
      substances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the results
      were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each other. A
      number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid. The
      engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a glass
      tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged into the
      acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag. Into this tube, through
      its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash, previously obtained
      by burning and reducing to ashes various plants, and in this way the acid
      and potash could act on each other through the clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged into
      azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was
      immediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the
      bottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a
      metallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in
      the bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore,
      produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all the
      phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very
      simple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would
      allow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite House
      and the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to the
      corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to support
      the wire. A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to produce the
      electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other for
      the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to
      communicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite House
      should be able to communicate with the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two
      stations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a piece
      of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The communication was thus
      established between the two poles; the current, starting from the positive
      pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was temporarily
      magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative pole. If the
      current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became unmagnetized. It
      was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet, which,
      attracted during the passage of the current, would fall back when the
      current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus obtained, Harding
      could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial, bearing the letters
      of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from one station to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day, Harding,
      having sent the current through the wire, asked if all was going on well
      at the corral, and received in a few moments a satisfactory reply from
      Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and every morning and evening he sent
      a telegram to the corral, which always received an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly,
      because it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and
      secondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus
      Harding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and Ayrton
      came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a cordial
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The resources
      of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased from day to
      day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The
      fourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one
      thought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains
      duly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but
      Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three
      hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him
      nearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest
      sailor considered it best to give up the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but
      in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and
      procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were,
      however, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration,
      swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed
      and the thunder continued to roll for some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus,
      but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate
      number. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood that
      their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and Pencroft&rsquo;s
      time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often mounted by
      Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider under the
      reporter&rsquo;s instruction, and they also harnessed them to the cart either
      for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different mineral
      productions required by the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far
      West Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything to
      fear from the heat, for the sun&rsquo;s rays scarcely penetrated through the
      thick foliage spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the left
      bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth
      of Falls River.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for they
      met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle. They also,
      during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars. Gideon Spilett
      had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil Herbert seconded
      him well. Armed as they were, they no longer feared to meet one of those
      beasts. Herbert&rsquo;s courage was superb, and the reporter&rsquo;s sang-froid
      astonishing. Already twenty magnificent skins ornamented the dining-room
      of Granite House, and if this continued, the jaguar race would soon be
      extinct in the island, the object aimed at by the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown
      parts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for
      other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the
      vast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup,
      who accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was
      anything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at the
      mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without result.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of the
      most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic
      apparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very complete.
      Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction, collodion for
      preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it sensitive,
      hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of ammonium in
      which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof, acetate of
      soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper, nothing was
      wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared, and before laying in
      the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was sufficient to soak them for
      a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful
      operators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the
      island, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance,
      the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade
      and the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the
      curious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the
      inhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It multiplies us,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully
      reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped as
      willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the richest
      shop-windows in Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was
      incontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not to
      be described, and his portrait was lifelike!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as if he was just going to grin!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very
      difficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own
      countenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of
      conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes
      rainy, but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the
      September of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been hoped.
      Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been supposed one morning&mdash;the 21 st&mdash;that the
      first snow had already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early
      from one of the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow at this time?&rdquo; answered the reporter, joining the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one
      thing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was
      covered with one uniform sheet of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be snow!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather it&rsquo;s very like it!&rdquo; replied Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for he
      really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of year
      and in such a temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;all our plants will be frozen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble
      Jup, who slid down to the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and
      dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun
      was obscured for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birds!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage. They
      had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they
      disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they had
      been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded
      winter at the touch of a fairy&rsquo;s wand. Unfortunately the change had been
      so sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring
      down one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years
      before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 19
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no
      communication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news from the
      civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had been on
      the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was now happening in their country? The picture of their native land
      was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the time they
      left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still staining with
      blood! It was a great sorrow to them, and they often talked together of
      these things, without ever doubting however that the cause of the North
      must triumph, for the honor of the American Confederation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island; or,
      at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln Island was
      out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,&mdash;as was besides
      proved by the maps,&mdash;for though there was no port, vessels might have
      visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water. But the
      surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and the
      colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed one
      day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered together
      in the dining-room of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been talking of America, of their native country, which they had
      so little hope of ever seeing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly we have only one way,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;one single way for
      leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to
      sail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a
      boat it is just as easy to build a ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in which we might go to the Pomoutous,&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;just as
      easily as we went to Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say no,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote in
      maritime questions; &ldquo;I do not say no, although it is not exactly the same
      thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had been
      caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island, we
      should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but
      twelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at
      least that distance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?&rdquo; asked the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; answered the
      sailor, &ldquo;and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,&rdquo;
       remarked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he will consent to come,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; returned the reporter; &ldquo;do you think that if Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s
      yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still living there,
      Ayrton would have refused to depart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, my friends,&rdquo; then said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;that Ayrton was not in
      possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But that
      is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among our
      chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now, Lord
      Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from Tabor
      Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I believe
      that he will return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and I will add that he will return soon, for it
      is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;I agree with you that the nobleman will
      return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not at
      Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the more certain,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;as Lincoln Island is not
      even marked on the map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;we ought to take the
      necessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on
      Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;and nothing is easier than to place
      in the hut, which was Captain Grant&rsquo;s and Ayrton&rsquo;s dwelling, a notice
      which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the position
      of our island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; remarked the sailor, &ldquo;that we forgot to take that
      precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should we have done it?&rdquo; asked Herbert. &ldquo;At that time we did not
      know Ayrton&rsquo;s history; we did not know that any one was likely to come
      some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season was
      too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;it was too late, and we must put off the voyage
      until next spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not probable,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;for Lord Glenarvan would
      not choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has
      already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is
      to say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not
      come till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October days
      to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must allow,&rdquo; said Neb, &ldquo;that it will be very unfortunate if the
      &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; has returned to these parts only a few months ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that it is not so,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and that Heaven has
      not deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; observed the reporter, &ldquo;that at any rate we shall know what we
      have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht has
      returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is evident,&rdquo; answered the engineer. &ldquo;So then, my friends, since we
      have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently, and
      if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; remarked Pencroft, &ldquo;it is well understood that if we do
      leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;it will be because we are far from
      all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends, his
      native land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to sail
      either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in the west,
      was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their accustomed
      occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their
      little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island. A
      complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists had
      but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the mouth
      of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay between
      them, which opened like a shark&rsquo;s jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding
      fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his
      domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden
      movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However,
      during the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a
      renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six days;
      then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a height of
      twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious
      for an excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo;
       anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of
      some duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed
      that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on shore,
      it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the absence of
      his companions. Master Jup was ordered to keep him company, and made no
      remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top,
      embarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo;
       tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety
      miles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the
      south coast between the port and the promontory. The wind being right
      ahead it was necessary to hug the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving
      port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six
      hours against the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was
      doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue sailing
      slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to anchor a few
      cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of the coast
      during the day. It was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute
      exploration of the coast they should not sail during the night, but would
      always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor near the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen,
      nothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the
      sailor, scarcely slept as well on board the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; as they would
      have done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however.
      Pencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack they
      could keep close to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already
      explored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They
      coasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything,
      avoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there. Several
      times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of the
      superb scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; arrived at the mouth of Falls River. Beyond,
      on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three miles further
      even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western spurs of the
      mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast! In
      proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and
      barren! It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as they
      are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to indicate
      that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet liquid basalt
      of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses would have
      terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on this part of the
      island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this
      shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they overlooked it from too
      great a height, but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance
      which could not perhaps be equaled in any corner of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; sailed along this coast for the distance of half a
      mile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes, from
      twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round like
      towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical like
      factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been more
      capricious in its terrible sublimity! Here, bridges were thrown from one
      rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the depths of
      which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted excavations
      presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns, spires, and
      arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed. Every caprice of
      nature, still more varied than those of the imagination, appeared on this
      grand coast, which extended over a length of eight or nine miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise
      bordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top, not
      being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were
      repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff. The engineer even
      observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those which
      the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go close in,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.
      Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there?
      But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could serve as a
      retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was washed by the
      surf. Soon Top&rsquo;s barks ceased, and the vessel continued her course at a
      few cables-length from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and sandy.
      A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which the
      colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other
      desert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of
      water-fowl. That evening the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; anchored in a small bay to the
      north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water there. The
      night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last light of day,
      and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say,
      Herbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and
      returned with several strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had done
      wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and cleverness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; set sail, and ran
      rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and
      freshening rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; observed Pencroft, &ldquo;I should not be surprised if a gale came up
      from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon, and
      now, this morning, those mares-tails don&rsquo;t forbode anything good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their height
      from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like light
      pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some sudden
      change in the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harding, &ldquo;let us carry as much sail as possible, and run for
      shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; will be safe
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and besides, the north coast is merely
      sand, very uninteresting to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be sorry,&rdquo; resumed the engineer, &ldquo;to pass not only to-night
      but to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,&rdquo;
       answered Pencroft, &ldquo;for the sky looks very threatening towards the west.
      Dirty weather is coming on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,&rdquo;
       observed the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine wind,&rdquo; replied the sailor; &ldquo;but we must tack to enter the
      gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks,&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;if we
      judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;do as you think best, we will leave it to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make your mind uneasy, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;I shall not
      expose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs
      than a sharp rock into those of my &lsquo;Bonadventure!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That which Pencroft called ribs was the part of his vessel under water,
      and he valued it more than his own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About fifteen miles,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of two hours and a half,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;and we shall
      be off the Cape between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock. Unluckily, the tide will
      be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf. I am afraid
      that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind and tide
      against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the more so that it is a full moon to-day,&rdquo; remarked Herbert, &ldquo;and
      these April tides are very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pencroft,&rdquo; asked Harding, &ldquo;can you not anchor off the Cape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor.
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a
      certainty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till
      about seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will try
      to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the night, and
      we will enter to-morrow at sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,&rdquo; answered Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;if there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it
      would be much more convenient for sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;and this time we shall have no obliging engineer
      to light a fire to guide us into port!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;we have never thanked you;
      but frankly, without that fire we should never have been able&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fire?&rdquo; asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mean, captain,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;that on board the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; 
      we were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we should
      have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the
      precaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October,
      on Prospect Heights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this time,&rdquo; continued the sailor, &ldquo;unless the idea occurs to Ayrton,
      there will be no one to do us that little service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No one!&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel, with
      the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I never
      lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither on
      Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 20
    </h2>
    <p>
      Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in his
      prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon increased
      to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from forty to
      forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea would have
      run under close-reefed topsails. Now, as it was nearly six o&rsquo;clock when
      the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; reached the gulf, and as at that moment the tide
      turned, it was impossible to enter. They were therefore compelled to stand
      off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft could not have gained
      the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the mainmast by way of a
      storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the vessel towards the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by the
      land, did not run very high. They had then little to fear from the waves,
      which always endanger small craft. The &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; would doubtlessly
      not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous masses of
      water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers could not
      sustain them. Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared for anything.
      Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but nevertheless he
      awaited the return of day with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity for
      talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter&rsquo;s ear by
      the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the mysterious
      influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon Spilett did
      not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable incident, the
      appearance of a fire on the coast of the island. The fire had actually
      been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen it with him! The
      fire had served to signalize the position of the island during that dark
      night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the engineer&rsquo;s
      hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that he had never
      done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to this incident as
      soon as the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; returned, and to urge Cyrus Harding to acquaint
      their companions with these strange facts. Perhaps it would be decided to
      make in common a complete investigation of every part of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet
      unknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little
      vessel stood off during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the wind,
      which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled Pencroft to
      enter the narrow gulf with greater ease. Towards seven o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, the &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; weathering the North Mandible Cape, entered
      the strait and glided on to the waters, so strangely enclosed in the frame
      of lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;this bay would make admirable roads, in which a
      whole fleet could lie at their ease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is especially curious,&rdquo; observed Harding, &ldquo;is that the gulf has been
      formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and accumulated
      by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is completely
      sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the stormiest weather,
      the sea here must be as calm as a lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; returned the sailor, &ldquo;since the wind has only that narrow
      entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north cape
      protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance of gusts
      very difficult. I declare our &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; could stay here from one end
      of the year to the other, without even dragging at her anchor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather large for her!&rdquo; observed the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;I agree that it is too large for
      the &lsquo;Bonadventure,&rsquo; but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a
      harbor in the Pacific, I don&rsquo;t think they would ever find a better place
      than this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in the shark&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; remarked Neb, alluding to the form of the
      gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right into its mouth, my honest Neb!&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;but you are not
      afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Herbert,&rdquo; answered Neb, &ldquo;and yet this gulf here doesn&rsquo;t please me
      much! It has a wicked look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf, just
      as I was thinking of presenting it to America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?&rdquo; asked the engineer, &ldquo;for a
      depth sufficient for the keel of the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; would not be enough
      for those of our iron-clads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is easily found out,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a lead-line,
      and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured nearly fifty
      fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding any bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;our iron-clads can come here after all! They
      would not run aground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;this gulf is a regular abyss, but, taking
      into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not
      astonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would say too,&rdquo; observed Herbert, &ldquo;that these cliffs were perfectly
      perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five or
      six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; then said the reporter, &ldquo;but I must point out to
      Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that, Mr. Spilett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of the
      island. I do not see a spot on which we could land.&rdquo; And, in fact, the
      steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for landing. They
      formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more wildness, the
      fiords of Norway. The &ldquo;Bonadventure,&rdquo; coasting as close as possible along
      the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which would allow the
      passengers to leave the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they
      could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as there
      was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his vessel
      towards the strait and passed out at about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Neb, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in
      those enormous jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more
      than eight miles. The head of the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was put towards Granite
      House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes,
      among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which
      seabirds frequented in thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o&rsquo;clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his left,
      entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five o&rsquo;clock
      the anchor of the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was buried in the sand at the mouth of
      the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton was
      waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them, giving
      vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made, and
      no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being
      resided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest of
      the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed
      their investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was agreed
      that they should direct the attention of their companions to the strange
      character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island, and of
      which the last was the most unaccountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on
      the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the
      twentieth time to the reporter,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption
      of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cyrus,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;it was certainly a fire lighted by
      the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it as I
      saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in the
      evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights, Cyrus
      Harding began by saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain
      incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I
      shall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak,
      supernatural&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supernatural!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from his
      mouth. &ldquo;Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,&rdquo; replied the engineer;
      &ldquo;unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed to
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak away, captain,&rdquo; answered the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you understood,&rdquo; then said the engineer, &ldquo;how was it that
      after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the
      interior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of
      my removal there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless, being unconscious&mdash;&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not admissible,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;But to continue. Have you
      understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from the
      cave in which I was lying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog&rsquo;s instinct&mdash;&rdquo; observed Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular instinct!&rdquo; returned the reporter, &ldquo;since notwithstanding the
      storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived at
      the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us continue,&rdquo; resumed the engineer. &ldquo;Have you understood how our dog
      was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his
      struggle with the dugong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I confess, not at all,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and the wound which the
      dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a
      sharp instrument; that can&rsquo;t be understood, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us continue again,&rdquo; said Harding. &ldquo;Have you understood, my friends,
      how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case
      happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace of a
      wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself so
      opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having broken
      its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined us at the
      very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the ladder was so
      obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how the document,
      which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into our hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular
      incidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft
      stared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of
      incidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their
      surprise to the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my word,&rdquo; said Pencroft at last, &ldquo;you are right, captain, and it is
      difficult to explain all these things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friends,&rdquo; resumed the engineer, &ldquo;a last fact has just been added
      to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, captain?&rdquo; asked Herbert quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,&rdquo; continued the
      engineer, &ldquo;you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I see you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You also, Herbert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, captain,&rdquo; cried Herbert, &ldquo;that fire was blazing like a star of the
      first magnitude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was it not a star?&rdquo; urged the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;for the sky was covered with thick clouds, and at
      any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr. Spilett
      saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will add,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;that the fire was very bright, and that
      it shot up like a sheet of lightning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! exactly,&rdquo; added Herbert, &ldquo;and it was certainly placed on the
      heights of Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my friends,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;during the night of the 19th
      of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment, not
      being able to finish his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not leave Granite House,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and if a fire
      appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be possible,
      and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of
      October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An
      inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very
      irritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time on
      Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest
      recesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and
      Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite
      House in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had explored
      the well, without discovering anything suspicious. The final resolve
      taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members of the
      colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would thoroughly
      search the whole of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the
      island which he had made his own personal property belonged to him
      entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to whom,
      willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked of those
      unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the
      marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the
      dominion of some supernatural power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the November
      of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would be severe and
      forward. The preparations for the winter season were therefore commenced
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter, however
      hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the musmons, very
      numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool necessary for
      the manufacture of this warm material.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this
      comfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to spend
      the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be better lodged
      than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon as the last work
      at the corral was finished. He did this towards the middle of April. From
      that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made himself useful on all
      occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took part in the pleasures
      of his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed
      in Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many
      violent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks
      to their very foundations. Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the
      island, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have been
      dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy swelled
      to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges would be swept
      away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore, which
      disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat against the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in
      which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the plateau
      of Prospect Heights. The mill and the poultry-yard particularly suffered.
      The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs, without which
      the safety of the birds would have been seriously threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana
      ventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that
      the most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross the
      stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage.
      Plantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly
      destroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to make
      use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful distance.
      Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their
      out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the
      frost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by Jup
      and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck, snipe,
      teal, and others. The access to these hunting-grounds was easy; besides,
      whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after having passed
      the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam Point, the hunters
      were never distant from Granite House more than two or three miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is to
      say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House did
      not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was the same
      with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and sheltered
      partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the hurricanes,
      already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the shore. The damages
      there were consequently of small importance, and the activity and skill of
      Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in October he returned to
      pass a few days in the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing
      strange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the most
      insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause. Top and
      Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any signs of
      uneasiness. It appeared, therefore, as if the series of supernatural
      incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of them during the
      evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly resolved that the
      island should be searched, even in those parts the most difficult to
      explore. But an event of the highest importance, and of which the
      consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from their projects
      Cyrus Harding and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning. Nature
      was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae which
      formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves of the
      banksias, deodars, and other trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different
      times, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o&rsquo;clock in the
      afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of
      reproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape
      Mandible to Claw Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft
      breeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there
      under the sun&rsquo;s rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room at
      Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay. Herbert
      proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained, he went
      away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark nook of
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived on
      his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon. He
      endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not
      accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a flaw in the glass,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier
      which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass
      almost fell from his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he
      extended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out the
      little spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on
      the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word
      only,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vessel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!

      Chapter 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had
      been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no
      communication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter
      had attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to a
      bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that was
      a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton, alone,
      under the circumstances which have been related, had come to join the
      little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October, other men
      had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that deserted sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she pass
      on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would
      definitely know what to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett,
      Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them what
      had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the horizon,
      and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on that which had
      made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed but it is really a vessel!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a voice which
      did not express any great amount of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she coming here?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to say anything yet,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;for her rigging
      alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; asked the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; replied Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to all
      the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which were
      aroused by this incident&mdash;the most important which had occurred since
      their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not in the
      situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly contending
      against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and incessantly
      tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries. Pencroft and
      Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and so rich, would
      not have left their island without regret. They were accustomed, besides,
      to this new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had
      as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship brought news from the
      world, perhaps even from their native land. It was bringing
      fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply their hearts
      were moved at the sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the
      window. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was at
      a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet,
      therefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have
      been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have
      been visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by Mount
      Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel&rsquo;s lookout. But why was
      the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to that part
      of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Island,
      which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the
      Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American coast?
      To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made
      by Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Duncan,&rdquo; as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s yacht, which had left
      Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch him.
      Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but that a
      vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A hundred
      and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in latitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must tell Ayrton,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and send for him immediately.
      He alone can say if it is the &lsquo;Duncan.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic
      apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House,
      sent this telegram:&mdash;&ldquo;Come with all possible speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the bell sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming,&rdquo; replied Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;Ayrton will recognize her without
      difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he recognizes her,&rdquo; added Pencroft, &ldquo;it will agitate him
      exceedingly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding; &ldquo;but now Ayrton is worthy to return on
      board the &lsquo;Duncan,&rsquo; and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s
      yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are ill-famed
      seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to our island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could defend it,&rsquo;, cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, my boy,&rdquo; answered the engineer smiling, &ldquo;but it would be better
      not to have to defend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A useless observation,&rdquo; said Spilett. &ldquo;Lincoln Island is unknown to
      navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do you
      think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding herself
      unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than avoid it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; added the engineer. &ldquo;It may even be said that it is the
      duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet known, and
      Lincoln Island is in this position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a few
      cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus
      Harding, after some moments&rsquo; thought, replied in the calm tone which was
      usual to him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:&mdash;we will
      communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we
      will leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name of
      the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us
      to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic with a useful
      station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;and that will be no small present which we
      shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost finished;
      names are given to every part of the island; there is a natural port,
      fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and manufactories; and there
      will be nothing to be done but to inscribe Lincoln Island on the maps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if anyone seizes it in our absence?&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; cried the sailor. &ldquo;I would rather remain all alone to guard it:
      and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn&rsquo;t steal it from him, like a watch from
      the pocket of a swell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel
      was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was nearer, but in
      what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not determine.
      However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all probability
      the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the wind was
      favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea being calm,
      she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows were not marked
      on the chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards four o&rsquo;clock&mdash;an hour after he had been sent for&mdash;Ayrton
      arrived at Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading him
      to the window,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have begged you to come here for an important
      reason. A ship is in sight of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim;
      then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this telescope,&rdquo; said Spilett, &ldquo;and look carefully, Ayrton, for it
      is possible that this ship may be the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; come to these seas for the
      purpose of taking you home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan!&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured Ayrton. &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; This last word escaped
      Ayrton&rsquo;s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did not twelve years&rsquo; solitude on a desert island appear to him a
      sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned,
      either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no! it cannot be the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Ayrton,&rdquo; then said the engineer, &ldquo;for it is necessary that we
      should know beforehand what to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During
      some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a
      word. Then,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed a vessel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I do not think she is the
      &lsquo;Duncan.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not think so?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace of
      smoke either above or near that vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she is simply sailing,&rdquo; observed Pencroft. &ldquo;The wind is favorable
      for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may be anxious
      to economize her coal, being so far from land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Ayrton,
      &ldquo;and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she is
      nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent.
      The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no part in
      the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it impossible to
      continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were particularly
      nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one place. Herbert
      felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual calm manner. Was not
      his country that where his master was? As to the engineer, he remained
      plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared rather than desired the
      arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little nearer the
      island. With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was a brig,
      and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used by the pirates
      of the Pacific. It was, therefore, reasonable to believe that the
      engineer&rsquo;s apprehensions would not be justified, and that the presence of
      this vessel in the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that
      the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely
      towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and
      top-gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in this
      direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind was from
      the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the
      height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon&mdash;a provoking
      circumstance, for it was already five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and the
      twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do when night comes on?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;Shall we
      light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still retained
      some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative. During the
      night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this ship gone,
      would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island? Who could
      foresee what the future would then have in store for the colonists?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;we ought to make known to that vessel, whoever
      she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the opportunity which
      is offered to us might be to create everlasting regrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port Balloon,
      and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense fire, the blaze
      of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave Granite
      House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood directly for
      Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached rapidly. Neb and
      Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the glass was put into
      Ayrton&rsquo;s hands, that he might ascertain for certain whether the ship was
      or was not the &ldquo;Duncan.&rdquo; The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig. The
      question was, whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts
      of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only five miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton
      soon let the glass fall again, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;! It could not be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and
      could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden,
      wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid
      sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; added the sailor, &ldquo;a flag is floating from her peak, but I
      cannot distinguish the colors of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour we shall be certain about that,&rdquo; answered the reporter.
      &ldquo;Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this
      ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the latest,
      we shall make his acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;It is best to know whom we have to deal
      with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow&rsquo;s colors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began
      to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig&rsquo;s ensign hung in
      folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the American flag,&rdquo; said Pencroft from time to time, &ldquo;nor the
      English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German
      colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would
      say it was all one color. Let&rsquo;s see: in these seas, what do we generally
      meet with? The Chilean flag?&mdash;but that is tri-color. Brazilian?&mdash;it
      is green. Japanese?&mdash;it is yellow and black, while this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the
      telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a
      hoarse voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black flag!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig, and
      they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious vessel!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a pirate
      vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas which
      still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of Lincoln
      Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for
      stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a sheltered port for the
      winter months? Was the settlers&rsquo; honest domain destined to be transformed
      into an infamous refuge&mdash;the headquarters of the piracy of the
      Pacific?
    </p>
    <p>
      All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists&rsquo; 
      imaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which must
      be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of pirates! It
      was that which the &ldquo;Duncan&rdquo; would have carried, had the convicts succeeded
      in their criminal design! No time was lost before discussing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;perhaps this vessel only wishes to
      survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is a
      chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to
      hide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily
      seen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also conceal
      the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires must be
      extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the
      island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our vessel?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy any
      of those rascals there to find her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton ascended
      the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal any indication
      of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their companions went to
      the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large quantity of branches
      and creepers, which would at some distance appear as natural foliage, and
      thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff. At the same time, the
      ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be at hand in case of an
      unexpected attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all these precautions had been taken,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, &ldquo;if the
      wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it&mdash;shall
      we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cyrus,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;and if necessary we will die to
      defend it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly.
      Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he, the
      former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton&rsquo;s mind, and going to
      him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Ayrton,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty,&rdquo; answered Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago
      behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming
      obscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union
      Bay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she
      had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One might
      have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay, for
      a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would have rested on
      her starboard quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first
      question. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the
      second. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and
      stand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in
      an hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag
      without deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which he
      and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these
      pirates&mdash;for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else&mdash;already
      visited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their colors.
      Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable peculiarities
      might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as yet unexplored
      parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not
      what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but be
      seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp.
      It would have been very important to know if the pirates were numerous and
      better armed than the colonists. But how was this information to be
      obtained?
    </p>
    <p>
      Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped the
      island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles of
      clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the
      twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on the
      shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being
      extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her whereabouts
      could not be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! who knows?&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;Perhaps that cursed craft will stand
      off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if in reply to the sailor&rsquo;s observation, a bright light flashed in the
      darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel was still there and had guns on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the hawse-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!
    </p>

      Chapter 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates&rsquo; intentions. They had
      dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident
      that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the
      beach!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined though
      they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their presence
      might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting themselves
      with landing on the shore without examining the interior of the island. It
      might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from
      the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile
      and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might
      escape their notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why was that flag hoisted at the brig&rsquo;s peak? What was that shot fired
      for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking
      possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And what had
      the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates&rsquo; guns? A few
      muskets only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; observed Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;here we are in an impregnable
      position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it
      is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible
      for them to penetrate into Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. &ldquo;They may spoil everything, destroy
      everything in a few hours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;and we have no means of
      preventing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they numerous? that is the question,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;If they are
      not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty, fifty,
      more perhaps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer, &ldquo;will
      you give me leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ayrton&mdash;&rdquo; answered the engineer, hesitating, &ldquo;you will risk your
      life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more than your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more than my duty to do,&rdquo; replied Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to the ship in the boat?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide
      between wind and water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?&rdquo; said
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it is risking your life,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no matter,&rdquo; answered Ayrton. &ldquo;Captain Harding, I ask this as a
      favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Ayrton,&rdquo; replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would
      have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accompany you,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistrust me!&rdquo; said Ayrton quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then more humbly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; exclaimed Harding with animation, &ldquo;no, Ayrton, Pencroft does not
      mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; returned the sailor, &ldquo;I only propose to accompany Ayrton as far
      as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one of
      these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too many
      to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the islet,
      and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do so.&rdquo;
       These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His
      plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night.
      Once arrived at the vessel&rsquo;s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains,
      might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the
      pirates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the beach.
      Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer less from
      the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might, indeed, be
      obliged to remain in it for several hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored a
      few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time they
      returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his shoulders,
      and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared
      in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite shore
      of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest the
      pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey, it was
      evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft,
      crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the holes of
      the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam
      noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights had
      recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he
      crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided through
      the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His head just
      emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of the brig,
      from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought only of the
      duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the danger which
      he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by
      sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or heard,
      arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took breath,
      then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of the
      cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors&rsquo; trousers. He put on
      a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not sleeping
      on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing.
      And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally
      struck Ayrton:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our brig is a famous acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sails well, and merits her name of the &lsquo;Speedy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for her captain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for Bob Harvey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be
      understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one of
      his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his
      criminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island
      this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools of
      all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had gone
      on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches, more
      ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying
      vessels, and massacring their crews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at
      the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew of the
      &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from Norfolk
      Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2&rsquo; south
      latitude, and 165deg 42&rsquo; east longitude, to the east of Australia, is
      found a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount
      Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea.
      This is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were
      lodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries. They
      numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible
      punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed under the
      orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine a collection of
      greater ruffians. Sometimes,&mdash;although very rarely,&mdash;notwithstanding
      the extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to
      escape, and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the
      Polynesian Archipelagoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly
      wished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig &ldquo;Speedy,&rdquo; anchored in sight
      of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship
      had scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and
      well known to Ayrton!
    </p>
    <p>
      The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a few,
      stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton learned
      that chance alone had brought the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; in sight of Lincoln Island; Bob
      Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding had
      conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position being
      marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and, if he
      found it suitable, of making it the brig&rsquo;s headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the black flag hoisted at the &ldquo;Speedy&rsquo;s&rdquo; peak, and the gun which had
      been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their colors, it
      was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no
      communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers&rsquo; domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently the
      island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so
      increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by
      Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their
      hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown, it
      would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.
      Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and Bob
      Harvey and his accomplices&rsquo; first care would be to massacre them without
      mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice of
      flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts intended to
      reside there, and since, in the event of the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; departing on an
      expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore,
      so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it would be necessary to
      fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and
      against whom any means would be right. So thought Ayrton, and he well knew
      that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would
      depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she
      carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his
      arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number of
      the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not
      hesitate to venture onto the &ldquo;Speedy&rsquo;s&rdquo; deck, which the extinguished
      lanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the cutwater,
      and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding among the
      convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the ship, and
      found that the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; carried four guns, which would throw shot of from
      eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching them that these
      guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern make, easily
      used, and of terrible effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was
      to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by listening
      to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on board. That was a
      large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to contend with! But
      now, thanks to Ayrton&rsquo;s devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he
      would know the strength of his adversaries, and would make his
      arrangements accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his
      companions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself,
      and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let
      himself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had
      said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was to
      sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus
      Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who,
      either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving out
      the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he thought
      of his preservers&mdash;those who had made him again a man, and an honest
      mm, those to whom he owed all&mdash;murdered without pity, their works
      destroyed, their island turned into a pirates&rsquo; den! He said to himself
      that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his
      old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a feeling
      of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an irresistible
      desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had on board. He
      would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always
      situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want
      of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be
      enough to destroy it in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous
      sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted
      at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished
      with weapons of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was
      loaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of
      destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the
      brig&rsquo;s poop at the powder-magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without stumbling
      over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and kicks. Ayrton
      was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at last he arrived at
      the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the
      magazine itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult
      operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But
      under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked a tall man, in a harsh voice, who,
      standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton drew back. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized his
      former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he must
      have thought Ayrton long since dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the
      waistband.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and
      attempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the
      powder-casks, and all would be over!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help, lads!&rdquo; shouted Bob Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on
      Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from
      their grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but a
      blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project.
      Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement on
      the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must reserve
      himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing for him
      but flight!
    </p>
    <p>
      But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to
      dare everything in order to rejoin his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were fired&mdash;one,
      aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate only slightly, and
      Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his adversaries, rushed
      towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck. Passing before the lantern,
      he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver. A profound
      darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two or three pirates, awakened
      by the noise, were descending the ladder at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not
      understanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and
      three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of a
      pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the
      bulwarks into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him
      like hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were Pencroft&rsquo;s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What
      were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the
      Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out
      on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel any
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates,
      had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night to
      make a descent on the island!
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and
      yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded?
      Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The
      tide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat
      was not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession
      of Harding and his companions!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the
      beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft, safe
      and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all
      that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had
      attempted to put into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that
      their situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew that
      Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers and well
      armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall into their
      hands, they must expect no mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall know how to die!&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go in and watch,&rdquo; answered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we any chance of escape, captain?&rdquo; asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! six against fifty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! six! without counting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.

      Chapter 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive, and
      did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their side, did
      not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last shots fired at
      Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the presence of the
      brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have been fancied that
      she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal with her match, and
      had left the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could
      see a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the &ldquo;Speedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;are the arrangements which appear
      to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It hides us from
      the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting their
      attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts should believe
      that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and consequently capable
      of resisting them. I therefore propose that we divide into three parties.
      The first of which shall be posted at the Chimneys, the second at the
      mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think it would be best to place it
      on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events delay, any attempt at
      landing. We have the use of two rifles and four muskets. Each of us will
      be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot, we need not
      spare our fire. We have nothing to fear from the muskets nor even from the
      guns of the brig. What can they do against these rocks? And, as we shall
      not fire from the windows of Granite House, the pirates will not think of
      causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it. What is to be
      feared is, the necessity of meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have
      numbers on their side. We must therefore try to prevent them from landing,
      but without discovering ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the
      ammunition. Fire often, but with a sure aim. We have each eight or ten
      enemies to kill, and they must be killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke
      in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece of work
      and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these arrangements
      without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be done but for
      each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated. Neb
      and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and brought back a
      sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and Ayrton, both very
      good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a
      mile. The four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft,
      and Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The posts were arranged in the following manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus
      commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy,
      from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any one from
      crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to
      cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet. In
      this way, shots being fired from four different points at once, the
      convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely peopled
      and strongly defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able to
      prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being cut
      off by the brig&rsquo;s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their boat
      to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time
      wrung each other&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his
      emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on
      the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton
      and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked
      on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely
      distinguish the brig in the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past six in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued from
      the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the
      sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her
      head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as
      Harding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from
      the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sinister black flag floated from the peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board
      were pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; remained silent. About thirty pirates could
      be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others posted in
      the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively surveying the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an
      account of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had this
      half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and with
      whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver at
      them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot? Had
      he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his
      object? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had
      thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts&rsquo; minds. But what
      they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before which the
      &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was, perhaps, a
      numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be seen, neither
      on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be absolutely
      deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had the
      inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain
      reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter the
      locality before he allowed his men to venture there.
    </p>
    <p>
      During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be
      observed on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even with
      his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the settlers
      crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his attention had
      been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers hiding the
      windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on the bare
      rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out, at
      that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes,
      in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose
      that the island was or could be inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board the
      &ldquo;Speedy.&rdquo; A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They were
      armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars, and the
      two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered the island.
      Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to land, for in
      the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The pirates from
      their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet,
      separated from it by a channel half a mile in width. However, it was soon
      evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the direction followed by the boat,
      that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel, but would land
      on the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them
      coming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the
      water at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts
      held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of
      the channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that it
      was Bob Harvey&rsquo;s intention to bring his brig as near as possible to the
      coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed every
      movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks which
      would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more than
      two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the tiller
      stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the rocks
      of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line fell
      backwards into the boat. Ayrton&rsquo;s and Pencroft&rsquo;s balls had struck them
      both at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued from
      the brig&rsquo;s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which
      sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two
      marksmen remained unhurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued its
      way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his
      comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However,
      instead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat
      coasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates
      pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the
      bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the shore
      terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a semicircular
      line, still protected by the brig&rsquo;s guns, they proceeded towards the mouth
      of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off the
      colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their number
      might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the fire from
      the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction.
      Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being cut
      off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show
      themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the
      &ldquo;Speedy&rsquo;s&rdquo; guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett, watching
      at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in ambush
      among the rocks at the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than
      two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with
      its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the
      pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard
      rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as
      they were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls
      saluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the
      boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the smoke,
      but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current, it
      shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before
      Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their
      fire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two
      remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries had
      certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men
      seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not
      missed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if
      they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be
      destroyed one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now seen how advantageous the engineer&rsquo;s arrangements had been. The
      pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed
      adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current,
      could get alongside the &ldquo;Speedy.&rdquo; Frightful cries were heard when they
      returned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired with
      no results.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly by
      the effect of the evening&rsquo;s potations, threw themselves into the boat. A
      second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their places, and
      while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge the colonists
      from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the
      Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and
      Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two
      well-directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and
      Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran
      across the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the
      channel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran to
      hide themselves in the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet was
      overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment, fresh
      reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat was
      rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her, were
      mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself, carried
      irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the Mercy. But
      the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to preserve
      them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of the
      river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush there,
      they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of the balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts, of whom
      some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their disposal; on
      the island were six, but who could not by any possibility reach Granite
      House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges being raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, &ldquo;hallo,
      captain! What do you think of it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;that the combat will now take a new
      form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to
      remain in a position so unfavorable for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t cross the channel,&rdquo; said the sailor. &ldquo;Ayrton and Mr. Spilett&rsquo;s
      rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry more than a
      mile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; replied Herbert; &ldquo;but what can two rifles do against the
      brig&rsquo;s guns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the brig isn&rsquo;t in the channel yet, I fancy!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose she does come there?&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; said Ayrton. &ldquo;The convicts might profit by the high tide
      to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it is true;
      but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no longer
      tenable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound them!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;it really seems as if the
      blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!&rdquo; observed
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait!&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Spilett and Neb?&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is
      yours and Spilett&rsquo;s rifles which must speak now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only too true. The &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; was beginning to weigh her anchor, and
      her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would be
      rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already weakened,
      it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering the channel,
      Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton&rsquo;s opinion, could not believe that she would
      dare to attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually
      advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the
      mainland by the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers, in
      ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing the
      latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did not
      believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they
      surveyed the islet, and examined the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton&rsquo;s and Gideon Spilett&rsquo;s rifles
      then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to
      two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even stopping
      to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other side of the
      islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and pulled away with
      all their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight less!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft. &ldquo;Really, one would have thought that Mr.
      Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, &ldquo;this is becoming more
      serious. The brig is making sail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anchor is weighed!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and she is already moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The
      &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been raised,
      she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing from the sea;
      the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel gradually
      approached the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her without
      giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What could be more
      terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short distance, to the
      brig&rsquo;s guns, without being able to reply with any effect? How could they
      then prevent the pirates from landing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be
      possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his
      determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite
      House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even,
      since they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that?
      The pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they would
      ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having their
      revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all, would
      not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep outside the
      islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a mile, and at
      that distance his shot could not be very destructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; repeated Pencroft, &ldquo;Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good
      seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig, if
      the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without his
      vessel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen that
      she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light, and as
      the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had absolute
      command over his vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to reconnoiter
      the channel, and she boldly entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pirate&rsquo;s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her
      broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and
      ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with
      ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood
      across the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrels! they are coming!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were
      rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at
      the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had
      acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at the
      moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon Spilett
      and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not without
      attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spilett! Neb!&rdquo; cried the engineer. &ldquo;You are not wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;a few bruises only from the ricochet! But
      that cursed brig has entered the channel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;and in ten minutes she will have anchored before
      Granite House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the
      convicts cannot see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, my opinion, too,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but once shut up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be guided by circumstances,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be off, then, and make haste!&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?&rdquo; asked
      the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the use of that, Pencroft?&rdquo; replied Harding. &ldquo;No. We will
      not separate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A bend
      of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig, but two
      or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told them that the
      &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; was at no great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite House,
      where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to rush into
      the large room, was the work of a minute only.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the
      &ldquo;Speedy,&rdquo; surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was
      incessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy
      post, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were
      splintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they were
      hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding&rsquo;s precaution
      of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door, penetrated into
      the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are discovered!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob
      Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage
      which concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack, when
      another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping
      aperture in the granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists&rsquo; situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered. They
      could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the stone,
      which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be done but to
      take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave their
      dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by
      frightful cries!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split in
      two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her
      criminal crew!

    <h2>
      Chapter 4
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;She has blown up!&rdquo; cried Herbert.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!&rdquo; returned
      Pencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has happened?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this
      unexpected catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this time, we shall know&mdash;&rdquo; answered the engineer quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we know?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have
      been exterminated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined Pencroft,
      Neb, and Herbert on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been
      raised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in
      that position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as in
      that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it was
      certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft
      could be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their
      occupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the
      surface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of the
      wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the hull,&mdash;which
      rendered the sudden disappearance of the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; perfectly inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the shrouds
      and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the others
      spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring up these
      riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the intention of
      towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the islet. But just
      as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon Spilett arrested
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the
      Mercy?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone to
      pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It was
      probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel, they had
      fled into the interior of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will deal with them later,&rdquo; said Harding. &ldquo;As they are armed, they
      will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are
      equal. To the most pressing business first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon but
      two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the
      brig could emerge from the water of the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of
      ropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united
      efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the boat
      picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which were
      immediately carried to the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of Bob
      Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some emotion,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I have been, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!&rdquo; returned the sailor warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were
      counted, which were already being carried by the current towards the open
      sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and the ship
      lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained below. Now
      the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men out to sea,
      would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in some corner of
      their island.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied in
      hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails which
      were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were
      absorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!
    </p>
    <p>
      The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was a
      perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in
      miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large
      number of useful articles. It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to
      the chest found at Flotsam Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; thought Pencroft, &ldquo;why should it be impossible to refloat
      the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from
      three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our
      &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go
      anywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She
      would be well worth the trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists&rsquo; chances of
      returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to decide
      this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide was quite
      low, so that every part of the brig&rsquo;s hull might be examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his
      companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost
      famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted for
      being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted, therefore, near the Chimneys,
      and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was talked of but the
      event which had so miraculously saved the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miraculous is the word,&rdquo; repeated Pencroft, &ldquo;for it must be acknowledged
      that those rascals blew up just at the right moment! Granite House was
      beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you guess, Pencroft,&rdquo; asked the reporter, &ldquo;how it happened, or
      what can have occasioned the explosion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,&rdquo; answered Pencroft. &ldquo;A convict
      vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are not sailors. Of
      course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing incessantly,
      some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;what astonishes me is that the explosion
      has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and besides there
      are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the ship had rather
      foundered than blown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that astonish you, my boy?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it astonishes me also, Herbert,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but when we visit the
      hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suppose that the &lsquo;Speedy&rsquo; simply
      foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; observed Neb, &ldquo;if there are rocks in the channel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Neb,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;you did not look at the right moment.
      An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose on an
      enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if she had only
      struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest
      vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just because she was not an honest vessel!&rdquo; returned Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; rejoined the sailor, &ldquo;but I would wager my head there
      are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak candidly, do you
      mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;whether rock or explosion, you will
      agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;but that is not the question. I ask
      Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say, Pencroft,&rdquo; said the engineer. &ldquo;That is all the answer I can
      make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to &ldquo;an explosion,&rdquo;
       and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent to admit that in
      that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like the beach, which he had
      often crossed at low water, there could be an unknown rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is to
      say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks which
      would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not have been a
      collision. Therefore, the vessel had not struck. So she had blown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it must be confessed that the sailor&rsquo;s arguments were reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the
      wreck. It was to be regretted that the brig&rsquo;s two boats had not been
      saved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the
      Mercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the brig
      went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hull of the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; was just beginning to issue from the water. The
      brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken, pressed
      down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the keel was
      visible along her whole length. She had been regularly turned over by the
      inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been at the same
      time manifested by an enormous water-spout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went
      down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the
      catastrophe, at least the effect produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from the
      beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn. Over a
      length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks, which would
      be impossible to stop up. Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks
      disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the ribs, the iron
      bolts, and treenails which united them. From the entire length of the hull
      to the stern the false keel had been separated with an unaccountable
      violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several places,
      was split in all its length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;that this vessel will be difficult
      to get afloat again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be impossible,&rdquo; said Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, &ldquo;the explosion, if
      there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the lower
      part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides! These great
      rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the explosion of a
      powder-magazine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a rock in the channel!&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;I will admit
      anything you like, except the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,&rdquo; said the
      engineer; &ldquo;perhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her
      destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to take an
      inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their
      preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still going
      down and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy masses
      of iron, had broken through in several places. The noise of the sea could
      be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the
      shattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had been
      but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The water
      would not return for several hours, and these hours must be employed in
      the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the entrance made in
      the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist up the barrels and
      chests. The boat received them and transported them to the shore. They
      took the articles as they came, intending to sort them afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that the
      brig possessed a very varied cargo&mdash;an assortment of all sorts of
      articles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools&mdash;such as the ships
      which make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with.
      It was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they
      agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln
      Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      However&mdash;and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment&mdash;not
      only, as has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from
      the shock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the
      interior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows.
      Partitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had
      burst in the interior of the brig. The colonists could easily go fore and
      aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated. They were not
      heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove, but simple
      packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer recognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then reached the stern of the brig&mdash;the part formerly
      surmounted by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton&rsquo;s directions,
      they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus Harding thought that it had
      not exploded; that it was possible some barrels might be saved, and that
      the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal coverings might not have
      suffered from contact with the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among a
      large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined with
      copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that the
      destruction of the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; could not be attributed to an explosion. That
      part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover, that
      which had suffered least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said the obstinate sailor; &ldquo;but as to a rock, there is not
      one in the channel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, how did it happen?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;Captain Harding doesn&rsquo;t know, and
      nobody knows or ever will know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to
      flow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the
      brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly as
      if moored by her anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to
      resume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it
      would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would not
      be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now five o&rsquo;clock in the evening. It had been a hard day&rsquo;s work for
      the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their fatigue,
      they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting the cases
      which composed the cargo of the &ldquo;Speedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well
      received. There were enough to clothe a whole colony&mdash;linen for every
      one&rsquo;s use, shoes for every one&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too rich!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;But what are we going to do with
      all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he
      caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms, balls of
      cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter&rsquo;s, joiner&rsquo;s, and blacksmith&rsquo;s
      tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least injured by their
      short sojourn in the water. Ah, two years before, how these things would
      have been prized! And now, even though the industrious colonists had
      provided themselves with tools, these treasures would find their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that
      daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do also
      to forget that the six survivors of the &ldquo;Speedy&rsquo;s&rdquo; crew had landed on the
      island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the deepest dye,
      and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their guard against
      them. Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would
      not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered desperate, these
      wretches would be capable of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the
      meantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped up
      near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn
      during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any
      attack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would
      have quickly given the alarm. The three following days&mdash;the 19th,
      20th, and 21st of October&mdash;were employed in saving everything of
      value, or of any use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the
      brig. At low tide they overhauled the hold&mdash;at high tide they stowed
      away the rescued articles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been
      torn from the hull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had
      swallowed the heavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and
      Pencroft, diving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and
      anchors of the brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which,
      floated by means of empty casks, were brought to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the wreck, as
      well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always enthusiastic in
      his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery to command the
      channel and the mouth of the river. With four guns, he engaged to prevent
      any fleet, &ldquo;however powerful it might be,&rdquo; from venturing into the waters
      of Lincoln Island!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk, bad
      weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended to
      blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong gale
      from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some of
      the wreck was cast up on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he
      carefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover any
      trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that
      concerned either the captain or the owners of the &ldquo;Speedy,&rdquo; and, as the
      name of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which
      would tell them her nationality. However, by the shape of her boats Ayrton
      and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after the castrophe&mdash;or, rather, after the fortunate, though
      inexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation&mdash;nothing
      more could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had
      disappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had
      contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would
      doubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb,
      strolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder,
      bearing traces of explosion. The edges of this cylinder were twisted and
      broken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive
      substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied with
      his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to
      Pencroft,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You persist, my friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in maintaining that the &lsquo;Speedy&rsquo; was
      not lost in consequence of a collision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain,&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;You know as well as I do that there
      are no rocks in the channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?&rdquo; said the engineer,
      showing the broken cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, that bit of pipe!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; resumed Harding, &ldquo;you remember that before she foundered the
      brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, captain,&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was
      this,&rdquo; said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&rdquo; returned Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A torpedo!&rdquo; exclaimed the engineer&rsquo;s companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who put the torpedo there?&rdquo; demanded Pencroft, who did not like to
      yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I can tell you is, that it was not I,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding;
      &ldquo;but it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable
      power!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo.
      Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union, he
      had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It was
      under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive substance,
      nitro-glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same nature, that
      the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the bottom of the
      brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage done to her hull
      being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her. The &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo;
       had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an
      ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! all was explained, everything&mdash;except the presence of the
      torpedo in the waters of the channel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, then,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;we can no longer be in doubt as
      to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps,
      abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be
      acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these
      two years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so
      fortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine.
      What his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after
      rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are
      not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of
      prodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much as
      we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the
      fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document, who
      placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the
      situation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that
      chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam
      Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island,
      which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that bullet found in
      the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the
      channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable
      events, for which we could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious
      being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our
      island, we shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from gratitude
      towards him. We have contracted a debt, and I hope that we shall one day
      pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett.
      &ldquo;Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the
      island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony. I
      will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border
      on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the supernatural
      were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication with us by the
      well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans? Was
      it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise? Was
      it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the dugong? Was it he, who
      as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that
      under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act?
      If it was he, he possesses a power which renders him master of the
      elements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter&rsquo;s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;if the intervention of a human being is
      not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means of
      action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still, but
      if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The question,
      then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or
      ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your opinion on the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave
      man, and he has my esteem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;but that is not an answer, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; then said Neb, &ldquo;my idea is, that we may search as long as we
      like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall not
      discover him till he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad, what you say, Neb,&rdquo; observed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of Neb&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but that is no reason for
      not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or
      not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my boy, give us your opinion,&rdquo; said the engineer, turning to
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, &ldquo;how I should like
      to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, my boy,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;so would I and all of us. I am not
      inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual face
      to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong, with a
      splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on clouds, a
      great ball in his hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Spilett, &ldquo;you are describing a picture of the
      Creator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;but that is how I imagine
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Ayrton?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; replied Ayrton, &ldquo;I can give you no better advice in
      this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you in
      your researches, I am ready to follow you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Ayrton,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;but I should like a more
      direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you
      have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as well
      as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important
      decision. Speak, therefore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; replied Ayrton, &ldquo;I think that we ought to do everything
      to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone. Perhaps he is
      suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too, as you said, have
      a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be only he who must
      have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch you knew, and who
      made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved.
      Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a man again. No, I will
      never forget him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is settled, then,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;We will begin our researches
      as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island unexplored.
      We will search into its most secret recesses, and will hope that our
      unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the
      harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts
      of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work
      finished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from
      the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was no
      want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all the
      treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there,
      methodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered
      as much from animals as from man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite.
      Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged
      either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general
      warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare utensils&mdash;in
      a word, all the stores of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of
      ordnance, which, at Pencroft&rsquo;s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle
      and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between the
      windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through
      the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union Bay. It was
      like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the islet would
      inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, &ldquo;now that
      our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried the
      range of our guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that is useful?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to know
      to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are
      provided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try them, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;However, I think that in
      making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the
      supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which
      will never fail us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?&rdquo; asked the reporter,
      who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so. However,&rdquo; added the engineer, &ldquo;we will be prudent.&rdquo; The
      engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make. Made
      of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be able to
      bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range. In fact, as
      regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball ought to be as
      extended as possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the
      condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial
      velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Harding to his companions, &ldquo;the initial velocity is in
      proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of these
      pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible
      power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of all others
      which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe that our guns
      will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give
      excellent results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!&rdquo;
       answered Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order.
      Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great
      care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and
      polishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were as
      brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States
      Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony,
      including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried.
      They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive
      power, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder: the
      projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Harding&rsquo;s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet, fell into
      the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and
      the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made
      it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired
      it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was prouder
      than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of
      Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having
      ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so as to
      try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its bursting,
      the match was lighted by means of a long cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the
      colonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of Mandible
      Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain,&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the
      reports themselves, &ldquo;what do you say of our battery? All the pirates in
      the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not one
      can land there now without our permission!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;it would be better not to
      have to make the experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;what ought to be done with regard to those six
      villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them to overrun
      our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are regular
      jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as
      such! What do you think, Ayrton?&rdquo; added Pencroft, turning to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that
      Pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved
      when Ayrton replied in a humble tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to
      speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a slow step he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute I am!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to
      speak here as any one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but his reserve does him honor, and it is
      right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; answered the sailor, &ldquo;and there is no fear of my
      doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton any
      pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these ruffians
      have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island of them as
      soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your opinion, Pencroft?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had
      committed some fresh act of hostility against us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t what they have done already enough?&rdquo; asked Pencroft, who did not
      understand these scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may adopt other sentiments!&rdquo; said Harding, &ldquo;and perhaps repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They repent!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft, think of Ayrton!&rdquo; said Herbert, taking the sailor&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;He
      became an honest man again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never
      thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature
      could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had
      landed on the island with Bob Harvey&rsquo;s accomplices, the murderers of the
      crew of the &ldquo;Speedy,&rdquo; and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought
      to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said be. &ldquo;Everybody is against me! You wish to be generous to
      those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn&rsquo;t repent it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What danger shall we run,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;if we take care to be always on
      our guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion. &ldquo;They
      are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each fired
      at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have they not done so?&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;No doubt because it was not
      their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.
      &ldquo;Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don&rsquo;t think
      anything more about them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Pencroft,&rdquo; said Neb, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make yourself out so bad as all that!
      Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good
      range of your guns, you would not fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,&rdquo; replied Pencroft
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;you have always shown much deference to my
      advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you please, Captain Harding,&rdquo; answered the sailor, who was
      not at all convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although Pencroft
      augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but were to be
      on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile. If any
      sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts, these
      wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in the
      situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At any rate,
      for humanity&rsquo;s sake alone, it would be right to wait. The colonists would
      no longer as before, be able to go and come without fear. Hitherto they
      had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts of the worst
      description, perhaps, were roaming over their island. It was serious,
      certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost! No
      matter! At present, the colonists had reason on their side against
      Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That remained to be seen.

    <h2>
      Chapter 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete
      exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would
      have two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was now
      indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of the
      pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were
      leading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished to set
      out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days duration,
      it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in
      order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One of the
      onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present,
      and a few days&rsquo; rest was necessary. The departure was, therefore, put off
      for a week, until the 20th of November. The month of November in this
      latitude corresponds to the month of May in the northern zones. It was,
      therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering the tropic of Capricorn,
      and gave the longest days in the year. The time was, therefore, very
      favorable for the projected expedition, which, if it did not accomplish
      its principal object, would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries,
      especially of natural productions, since Harding proposed to explore those
      dense forests of the Far West, which stretched to the extremity of the
      Serpentine Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that
      the work on Prospect Heights should be finished off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the
      domesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should
      spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally
      supplied the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of
      them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than
      formerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough for
      the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything occurred
      at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn the
      colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager,
      and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all in
      order at the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project which
      would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was
      necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which was
      already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the
      southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level of
      the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite beneath
      it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two
      openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls
      River.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not
      exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by
      means of well-cemented blocks of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that
      part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the
      overflow of the lake formerly escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and
      worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not
      fail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be
      safe from any surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and
      Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was
      very anxious to know if the little creek in which the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was
      moored, had been visited by the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;landed on the south coast, and if they
      followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the
      little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn&rsquo;t give half-a-dollar for our
      &lsquo;Bonadventure.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft&rsquo;s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit to Port
      Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his companions set
      off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed. Pencroft,
      ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his rifle, shook
      his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one who approached
      too near him, whether &ldquo;man or beast,&rdquo; as he said. Gideon Spilett and
      Herbert also took their guns, and about three o&rsquo;clock all three left
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had crossed,
      he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should announce the
      colonists&rsquo; return, and that at the signal Neb should return and
      reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the southern
      coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles and a half,
      but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to traverse it. They
      examined all the border of the road, the thick forest, as well as Tabor
      Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no doubt, not having yet
      discovered the number of the colonists, or the means of defense which they
      had at their disposal, had gained the less accessible parts of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However, Port
      Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely be
      discovered either from the land or the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;the blackguards have not been there yet. Long
      grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far
      West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s very lucky, for if they had found the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;,&rdquo; added
      Herbert, &ldquo;they would have gone off in her, and we should have been
      prevented from returning to Tabor Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; remarked the reporter, &ldquo;it will be important to take a document
      there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island, and Ayrton&rsquo;s
      new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; is always there, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; answered the
      sailor. &ldquo;She and her crew are ready to start at a moment&rsquo;s notice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our exploration
      of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the stranger, if
      we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island as about
      Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author of the
      document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the return of
      the yacht!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;who in the world can he be? The fellow knows
      us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should
      he conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of
      honest men isn&rsquo;t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily? Can
      he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain any
      longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and
      looked about the deck of the &ldquo;Bonadventure.&rdquo; All at once, the sailor
      having examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was secured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is queer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Pencroft?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, it was not you?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running
      bowline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mistaken, Pencroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mistaken!&rdquo; declared the sailor. &ldquo;My hand does it so naturally,
      and one&rsquo;s hand is never mistaken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then can the convicts have been on board?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;but what is certain, is
      that some one has weighed the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;s&rsquo; anchor and dropped it
      again! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has
      been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat
      that some one has been using our vessel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather
      gone off with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone off! where to&mdash;to Tabor Island?&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;Do you
      think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,&rdquo; rejoined the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However that may be,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;as sure as my name is
      Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; has sailed
      without us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could
      dispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more
      or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the sailor,
      he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised and then
      dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers, unless the
      vessel had been employed in some expedition?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was it we did not see the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; pass in the sight of the
      island?&rdquo; observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every
      possible objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;they would only have to start in
      the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the island
      in two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;I ask again, what object could the
      convicts have had in using the &lsquo;Bonadventure,&rsquo; and why, after they had
      made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;we must put that among the
      unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief
      thing is that the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; was there, and she is there now. Only,
      unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very
      likely not find her again in her place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Pencroft,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;would it not be wisest to bring the
      &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; off to Granite House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy is
      a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps yes,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;At any rate, since we must leave Granite
      House for a long expedition, I think the &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; will be safer here
      during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here until the
      island is rid of these blackguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly my opinion,&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;At any rate in the event
      of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at the mouth
      of the Mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the convicts pay her another visit,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, &ldquo;not finding her here, they would not be
      long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our
      absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore,
      with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our
      return we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent to
      bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear any
      unpleasant visits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled. Let us be off,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House,
      told the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their
      arrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the
      sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the
      islet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to
      make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the
      &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; would be always within reach, under the eyes of the
      colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from
      the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the
      plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of the
      despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish the
      engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the
      corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact, two
      days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided that
      on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he
      should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on
      Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as to be
      ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was,
      therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists&rsquo; uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no
      longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control
      over his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night?
    </p>
    <p>
      They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;perhaps some accident has happened to the
      telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;It is possible, indeed,
      that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not
      received his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited, of course not without some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric
      current along the wire and received no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried again: the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off to the corral,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And well armed!&rdquo; added Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone and
      that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends to
      Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he
      watched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to force
      the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them, and as a
      last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where, the lift once
      raised, he would be in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair to the
      corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions had
      passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound
      crowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights, immediately
      took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns, ready to fire on
      the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and the two guns had
      been loaded with ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have
      concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really
      formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them, sometimes
      running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always
      quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And they could be sure
      that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised, but would bark
      at the least appearance of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which
      connected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two
      miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty.
      The posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at
      that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and
      on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped,
      exclaiming,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wire is broken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was
      standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The unexpected
      explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident that the
      despatches from Granite House had not been received at the corral, nor
      those from the corral at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the wind that blew down this post,&rdquo; observed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;The earth has been dug up round its foot,
      and it has been torn up by the hand of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, the wire is broken,&rdquo; added Herbert, showing that the wire had
      been snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the fracture recent?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Herbert, &ldquo;it has certainly been done quite lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the corral! to the corral!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral,
      having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with
      redoubled speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in the
      corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived,
      but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy, for, a more
      unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening
      before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not without a motive that all
      communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite House, and
      who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this
      communication?
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were
      sincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck
      down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the
      little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows of
      the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not be out
      of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their guns
      were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every side.
      Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage
      could be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the
      corral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton&rsquo;s voice
      could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us enter,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about
      twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it back,
      when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a cry of
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Herbert&rsquo;s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have killed him!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My boy! They have killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad&rsquo;s heart was still
      beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but he must be carried&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Granite House? that is impossible!&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the corral, then!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a
      convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few seconds,
      before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the
      heart by Harding&rsquo;s dagger, more sure even than his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over
      the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which
      supported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor Herbert
      was lying on Ayrton&rsquo;s bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor&rsquo;s grief was terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves were
      choked with emotion. They could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the poor
      boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not passed
      through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered without
      acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine. He knew a little of
      everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds
      produced either by a sword-bayonet or shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he
      proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which
      Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock, the
      ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent
      concussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt it
      beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      These symptoms were very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert&rsquo;s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with
      handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,&mdash;an oval below
      the chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had
      been hit by the bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they
      did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his
      last sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by which
      the ball had immediately escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised!&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;the ball is not in the body, and we
      shall not have to extract it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the heart?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;no! He is not dead. His pulse
      still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy&rsquo;s sake, calm
      yourself. We have need of all our self-possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not make us lose it, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down
      his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and
      proceed methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the ball,
      entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued behind
      between the third and fourth. But what mischief had the ball committed in
      its passage? What important organs had been reached? A professional
      surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at once, and still
      more so the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the
      inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with the
      local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound, perhaps
      mortal! Now, what styptics, what antiphlogistics ought to be employed? By
      what means could inflammation be prevented?
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should be
      dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett that
      a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid water, and
      compressing their lips. The hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert
      was already too much enfeebled by the loss of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds
      with cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must not be moved.&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;He is in the most favorable
      position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate easily, and
      absolute rest is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! can&rsquo;t we carry him to Granite House?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay the villains off!&rdquo; cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a
      menacing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert was
      still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity. You
      must aid me with your advice, your experience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage, my friend,&rdquo; answered the engineer, pressing the reporter&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;Judge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had
      lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility. He
      seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft had
      torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first of
      all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause their
      immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation, and the
      suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should
      be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the
      inflammation which might occur?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold
      water, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed
      against inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent in
      grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians. Cold
      water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute rest,
      and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable advantage,
      since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is
      dangerous during the first days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good
      sense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses of
      linen were applied to poor Herbert&rsquo;s two wounds, and were kept constantly
      wet with cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting
      in things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same
      which the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to
      make some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any
      notice of it. His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night
      passed without his becoming conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert&rsquo;s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any
      moment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his
      companions slightly revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor. He
      opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Pencroft.
      He uttered two or three words. He did not know what had happened. They
      told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly still, telling him
      that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds would heal in a few
      days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water with
      which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of the
      wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular way, the fever did
      not increase, and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not
      involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the swelling of his heart gradually
      subside. He was like a sister of mercy, like a mother by the bed of her
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;Tell me again
      that you will save Herbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we will save him!&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;The wound is serious, and,
      perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation of
      this organ is not fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; answered Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in the
      corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing Herbert.
      They did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the
      convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding and
      the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton.
      Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he
      resisted, and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was
      only too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade,
      had clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern spur
      of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung. It was one of those whose
      object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth of the
      Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was found
      outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey&rsquo;s crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed,
      and the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could
      they see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut, or in
      the palisade. The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been supplied,
      had disappeared with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The unhappy man has been surprised,&rdquo; said Harding, &ldquo;and as he was a man
      to defend himself, he must have been overpowered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is to be feared!&rdquo; said the reporter. &ldquo;Then, doubtless, the
      convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of
      everything, and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident,
      too, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to beat the forest,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;and rid the island
      of these wretches. Pencroft&rsquo;s presentiments were not mistaken, when he
      wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us all these
      misfortunes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;but now we have the right to be merciless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;we are obliged to wait some time, and
      to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to
      Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Neb?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb is in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must not come!&rdquo; returned Cyrus Harding quickly. &ldquo;He would be murdered
      on the road!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is
      impossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could
      not do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Cyrus,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;you must not expose yourself!
      Your courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching the
      corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if you
      go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Neb?&rdquo; repeated the engineer. &ldquo;It is now four-and-twenty hours since
      he has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,&rdquo; added
      Spilett, &ldquo;he will be killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there really no way of warning him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards and
      forwards seemed to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am not I here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top!&rdquo; exclaimed Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal sprang at his master&rsquo;s call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Top will go,&rdquo; said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of
      the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; said Harding. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave
      Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by
      Top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same
      time asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and
      fastened to Top&rsquo;s collar in a conspicuous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top, my dog,&rdquo; said the engineer, caressing the animal, &ldquo;Neb, Top! Neb!
      Go, go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Top bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of
      him. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he
      could clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding nor
      the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among the
      grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb, Top! Neb!&rdquo; repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction of
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will get there!&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo; asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter
      re-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the
      compresses always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do at
      that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while
      attentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at which
      an attack might be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlers awaited Top&rsquo;s return with much anxiety. A little before
      eleven o&rsquo;clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were behind
      the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb
      would have sent him back immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard,
      followed by repeated barks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the
      wood, he fired in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top, Top!&rdquo; exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog&rsquo;s great honest head
      between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words,
      traced in Neb&rsquo;s large writing:&mdash;&ldquo;No pirates in the neighborhood of
      Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to
      kill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but to
      treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for just
      now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not being
      seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to
      be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements, therefore, for living
      in the corral, of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length
      of time. Ayrton&rsquo;s house had been provided with all that was necessary for
      existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival of the settlers, had
      not had time to pillage it. It was probable, as Gideon Spilett observed,
      that things had occurred as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern
      shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine
      Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they had
      reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the right
      bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin,
      among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they could not have
      been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited. There they had
      regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their
      abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton&rsquo;s arrival had surprised them,
      but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and&mdash;the rest
      may be easily imagined!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the convicts,&mdash;reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,&mdash;were
      roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to their
      attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! There is nothing else to be done!&rdquo; repeated Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;When
      Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and have
      satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our grand
      expedition at the same time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the search for our mysterious protector,&rdquo; added Gideon Spilett,
      finishing the engineer&rsquo;s sentence. &ldquo;And it must be acknowledged, my dear
      Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when
      it was most necessary to us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett, and that
      his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising
      itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert&rsquo;s life before
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the colonists&rsquo; saddest thought. Several days passed, and the poor
      boy&rsquo;s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a suitable
      temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the wounds. It
      even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly sulphurous,&mdash;which
      was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action
      on the healing. The suppuration was much less abundant, and thanks to the
      incessant care by which he was surrounded!&mdash;Herbert returned to life,
      and his fever abated. He was besides subjected to a severe diet, and
      consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but there was no want
      of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to
      him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful
      in dressing the lad&rsquo;s wounds. All the linen in the house had been
      sacrificed. Herbert&rsquo;s wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were
      pressed neither too much nor too little, so as to cause their
      cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory reaction. The reporter
      used extreme care in the dressing, knowing well the importance of it, and
      repeating to his companions that which most surgeons willingly admit, that
      it is perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well
      performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better. He
      had begun to take some nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at his
      nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft&rsquo;s efforts, who talked
      incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him the most
      improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton,
      whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that he was at the
      corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert, contented himself
      by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to defend Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;these pirates! they are gentlemen who have no
      right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by
      kindness! I&rsquo;ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good
      bullet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have they not been seen again?&rdquo; asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; answered the sailor, &ldquo;but we shall find them, and when you
      are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will dare
      to meet us face to face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! your strength will return gradually! What&rsquo;s a ball through the
      chest? Nothing but a joke! I&rsquo;ve seen many, and I don&rsquo;t think much of
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication
      occurred, Herbert&rsquo;s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what would
      have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated,&mdash;if,
      for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had
      had to be amputated?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Spilett more than once, &ldquo;I have never thought of such a
      contingency without shuddering!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, if it had been necessary to operate,&rdquo; said Harding one day to
      him, &ldquo;you would not have hesitated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cyrus!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but thank God that we have been spared
      this complication!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic
      of that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once
      more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not a
      time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone on the
      island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each other.
      Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some circumstance
      might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount. It appeared to
      him besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate, had
      entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and a half which had
      elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might be said that they had
      had everything their own way. The island had abundantly supplied them with
      minerals, vegetables, animals, and as Nature had constantly loaded them,
      their science had known how to take advantage of what she offered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain
      occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all
      that could only be for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the convicts&rsquo; ship had appeared in the waters of the island, and
      if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of them,
      at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the island,
      and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived. Ayrton had
      no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at
      the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded
      almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at
      the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This was often repeated by
      the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the intervention, so
      strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served them so well, had
      now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose
      existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had he in his turn
      succumbed?
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined that
      because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were men to
      despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face, they
      analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they stood
      firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last to
      strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against it.

    <h2>
      Chapter 9
    </h2>
    <p>
      The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One
      thing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be
      brought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral house
      was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite dwelling.
      Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants,
      notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some shot
      from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that
      impregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and
      any attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited
      impatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from
      his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the
      communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The
      courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would
      not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him, as
      it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might
      deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at
      Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it
      gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton&rsquo;s disappearance they
      were only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and
      this was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the
      trouble of which he was the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act against
      the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November by Cyrus
      Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert was asleep
      and could not hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the
      impossibility of communicating with him, &ldquo;I think,&mdash;like you, that to
      venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot
      without being able to return it. But do you not think that the best thing
      to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I was thinking,&rdquo; answered Pencroft. &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;re
      not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding
      approves, I&rsquo;m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is
      equal to another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is he equal to five?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will join Pencroft,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and both of us, well-armed and
      accompanied by Top&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;let us reason
      coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew
      that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct
      attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they are
      sure to fire the first shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain,&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;a bullet does not always reach its
      mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
      &ldquo;Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should remain here
      alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you
      leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they
      will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here
      but a wounded boy and a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, captain,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with sullen
      anger. &ldquo;You are right; they will do all they can to retake the corral,
      which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold it against
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if we were only at Granite House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were at Granite House,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;the case would be
      very different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one,
      while the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we are
      at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions understood
      it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only Ayrton was still one of us!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;Poor fellow!
      his return to social life will have been but of short duration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is dead,&rdquo; added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?&rdquo; asked
      Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if they had any interest in doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
 &ldquo;What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting
all that he owes us&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful
      supposition without hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said Harding, taking the sailor&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;that is a wicked idea
      of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus. I
      will answer for Ayrton&rsquo;s fidelity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; added the reporter quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong,&rdquo; replied Pencroft; &ldquo;it was a wicked idea
      indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I&rsquo;m not in
      my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly, and I have
      never felt so excited as I do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient, Pencroft,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;How long will it be, my
      dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is difficult to say, Cyrus,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;for any
      imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence is
      progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from now&mdash;well,
      we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the first
      days of December. At this time two months of spring had already passed.
      The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The forests of the
      island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching when the usual
      crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of Prospect Heights
      would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural labors,
      interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the
      corral must have been to the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so
      without impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the tour of
      the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was
      ready for any emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog would
      have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be
      concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and that
      the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett,
      who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south of
      the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no longer
      his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting among
      the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious object
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice,
      while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering
      himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the
      presence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by
      half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was
      because danger was neither near nor approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following him
      prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush, and drew
      out a rag.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately
      brought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists, who
      found that it was a fragment of Ayrton&rsquo;s waistcoat, a piece of that felt,
      manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Pencroft,&rdquo; observed Harding, &ldquo;there has been resistance on the
      part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in
      spite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; answered the sailor, &ldquo;and I repented of my suspicion a long
      time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the
      incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him
      away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still
      living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, indeed,&rdquo; replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a hope, to which Ayrton&rsquo;s companions could still hold. Indeed,
      they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had fallen
      by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not killed him
      at first, if they had brought him living to another part of the island,
      might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even,
      one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce,
      the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows but that they had
      conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves? He
      would have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him
      turn traitor!
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and it
      no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again. On his
      side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all he could to
      escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a powerful aid to
      the settlers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;if happily Ayrton did manage to
      escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know of
      the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and
      consequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;and
      that we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our
      house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops. But
      it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return to
      Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers was
      needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral! Therefore,
      one idea occupied his mind&mdash;to leave the corral, and when! He
      believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his strength
      would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight of the sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with
      good reason, that Herbert&rsquo;s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way,
      did not give the order to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his two
      friends to yield to the lad&rsquo;s wish, and God alone knew that this
      determination might cause them grief and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 29th of November, seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The three
      settlers were talking in Herbert&rsquo;s room, when they heard Top utter quick
      barks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house.
      Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it was with
      pleasure, not anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not an enemy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Ayrton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two
      companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground
      inside the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most
      cordial reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neb has sent him to us,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;he must have some note on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important matter
      to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid
      messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could, nor even Top
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup&rsquo;s neck hung a small bag, and in
      this bag was found a little note traced by Neb&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read
      these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday, six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plateau invaded by convicts.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                             &ldquo;Neb.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered the
      house. What were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that was
      disaster, devastation, ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter,
      guessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no
      longer doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must go; I can bear the journey. I must
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, then!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a
      litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion
      of the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it would
      have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have been two
      guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would they not,
      on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free? Was it
      impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to
      advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and the
      reporter raised Herbert&rsquo;s mattress and placed it on the bottom of the
      cart. The weather was fine. The sun&rsquo;s bright rays glanced through the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the guns ready?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled
      gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you comfortable, Herbert?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, captain,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be uneasy, I shall not die on the
      road!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up all
      his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his failing
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to give the
      signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to despair&mdash;killed
      him perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be
      silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and the
      onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than
      that which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart
      would have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was
      necessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to
      the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart,
      ready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the
      convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb&rsquo;s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had
      shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the
      corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five
      miles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be
      safe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would
      probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House.
      However, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter armed
      with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides
      of the road, signalized no danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft&rsquo;s guidance. It had left the corral
      at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles had been
      cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was as deserted as
      all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the Mercy and the
      lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood appeared as deserted
      as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge
      over Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place;
      supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after having
      passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they would have
      taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen. But
      the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders thought of
      abandoning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the villains!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the
      buildings at the poultry-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having
      devastated it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Herbert?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett returned to the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had lost consciousness!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      Chapter 10
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with
      which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer. Herbert&rsquo;s
      critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the removal
      prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter could not
      affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of the result. The
      cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some branches, disposed
      as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the unconscious Herbert.
      Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Pencroft were at the foot
      of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to the plateau of Prospect
      Heights. The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was soon stretched on his
      bed in Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for a
      moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur a
      few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his wounds.
      He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed. There was
      nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration? why was
      Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish sleep,
      and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this time,
      Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to
      his master the events of which the plateau had just been the theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on
      the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who was
      watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of the
      pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he could
      not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was not
      enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get up to
      Granite House, where at least he was in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the
      convicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn his
      master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the corral
      themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th of
      November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days since
      Neb had had other news than that brought by Top&mdash;disastrous news:
      Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and
      sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to fear, for
      the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the buildings, the
      plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates! Would it
      not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he ought to do, and to warn
      him, at least, of the danger which threatened him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew
      the orang&rsquo;s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof. Jup
      understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced before
      him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven the cart
      thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The active orang
      would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of which the
      convicts, besides, would think he was a native.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup&rsquo;s neck, he
      brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a
      long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jup Jup! corral, corral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach,
      and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts&rsquo; attention having
      been in the least excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did well, Neb,&rdquo; said Harding, &ldquo;but perhaps in not warning us you
      would have done still better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery
      the removal had so seriously checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the beach.
      Not knowing the number of the island&rsquo;s inhabitants, they might suppose
      that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have
      remembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been fired
      both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not wish to
      expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them,
      and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave themselves up,
      therefore, to their instinct of destruction,&mdash;plundering, burning,
      devastating everything,&mdash;and only retiring half an hour before the
      arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk of
      being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was
      consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though in
      vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts
      constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln
      Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater
      misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while Cyrus
      Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the extent
      of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of Granite
      House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not have escaped
      destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more easily
      reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect Heights.
      Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its left bank
      without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the other side of
      the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive any suspicious
      indications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts
      knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having seen them
      pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of the
      plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course of
      the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now
      without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait on
      opportunity to recommence the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear
      the island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert&rsquo;s condition.
      Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with
      the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned
      everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which
      were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not
      suffered less.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a store
      of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable,
      the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the
      plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters
      of the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were
      dabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal
      anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word.
      Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which still
      rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed
      on the island! Herbert&rsquo;s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that a
      more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological
      disturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and Gideon
      Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would be
      powerless to fight against it!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness, and
      symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks were
      the only remedies at the colonists&rsquo; disposal. The fever was not as yet
      very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at regular
      intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely pale, was
      at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and tremblings.
      His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst intense. To
      this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his skin reddened;
      his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out after which the
      fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly five hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was now
      seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any cost
      before it should assume a more serious aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in order to cure it,&rdquo; said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;we need a
      febrifuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A febrifuge&mdash;&rdquo; answered the engineer. &ldquo;We have neither Peruvian
      bark, nor sulphate of quinine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but there are willows on the border of the
      lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a substitute
      for quinine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us try it without losing a moment,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a
      succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut
      tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently
      necessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as
      Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no
      means for extracting its essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black
      willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and
      reduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat
      delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return
      either during the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be
      that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return
      next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert
      remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom
      alarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert&rsquo;s liver became
      congested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was also
      affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the
      engineer aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a malignant fever,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A malignant fever!&rdquo; cried Harding. &ldquo;You are mistaken, Spilett. A
      malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must
      previously have existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mistaken,&rdquo; replied the reporter. &ldquo;Herbert no doubt contracted
      the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had
      one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a
      third, he is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the willow bark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is insufficient,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;and the third attack of a
      malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always
      fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would have
      gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered
      during the day of the 7th of December and the following night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was
      terrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards
      Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to die!
      The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive a
      third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which went
      to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts, he called
      to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious being,&mdash;that
      powerful unknown protector,&mdash;whose image was stamped upon his mind;
      then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely prostrated him.
      Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting
      fits. Herbert&rsquo;s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered
      further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic
      febrifuge,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;Herbert will be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night arrived&mdash;the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the
      good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who was
      loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed against
      this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could overcome it,
      was not to be found in Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more
      violent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected,
      and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must
      infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was exhausted,
      and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards three o&rsquo;clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry. He
      seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him,
      terrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was
      endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his
      arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in
      at the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this
      day was to be poor Herbert&rsquo;s last!
    </p>
    <p>
      A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these words:&mdash;&ldquo;SULPHATE
      OF QUININE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0053" id="link2HCH0053">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>
    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      Chapter 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two hundred
      grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to his lips.
      The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was
      certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.
    </p>
    <p>
      This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came
      there might be discussed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some coffee!&rdquo; said Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett
      threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in
      making Herbert drink the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had not
      yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would not
      return!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The
      mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment,
      when they had despaired of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss
      this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than
      ever. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into Granite
      House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of the genius
      of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius himself.
      During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to Herbert every
      three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day some improvement in Herbert&rsquo;s condition was apparent.
      Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject to
      frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was bestowed
      on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who
      had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were animated by
      returning hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December,
      Herbert&rsquo;s convalescence commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no
      access of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such
      docility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss.
      Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third
      attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace.
      Since then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will find him!&rdquo; repeated the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too energetic
      embrace from the worthy Pencroft!
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which the
      colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried. They
      commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and a
      tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert&rsquo;s
      recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of
      Granite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which
      could not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what
      numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of
      Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer and
      Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions did
      not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this
      uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered,
      the expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be
      undertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all the
      strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain satisfaction
      from the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Herbert&rsquo;s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of the
      liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely
      healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau of
      Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was
      possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The
      grain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for the
      approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard, wall,
      or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his companions
      were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very probably pay
      another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to give them an
      opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. When the island
      should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding.
      The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January, at
      first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength visibly
      returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen years of
      age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and commanding
      presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring care,&mdash;and
      Dr. Spilett was very strict,&mdash;made rapid progress. Towards the end of
      the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect Heights, and the
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with Pencroft
      and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought he might now
      settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of February was
      fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would be favorable to
      the researches they intended to make all over the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and
      were important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite House
      until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to
      exterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on
      the other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the
      fortunes of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast from
      Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the
      neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral
      and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the
      spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of
      Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border
      of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of
      Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the
      Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the left bank of
      Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three
      quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the north, and the
      west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed. Consequently, many
      millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through
      the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of
      the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral, where
      it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge, either to
      pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the devastation of
      the corral would have been an accomplished fact by this time, and it would
      be too late to prevent it, or it had been the convicts&rsquo; interest to
      entrench themselves there, and there would be still time to go and turn
      them out on their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the
      settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would
      make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a road
      which would place Granite House in communication with the end of the
      peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a long
      journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils
      were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen
      from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it was necessary to
      remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about the woods, and
      that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and
      received. It was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers
      should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top and
      Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible dwelling
      needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure, was
      consecrated entirely to repose, and&mdash;thanksgiving addressed by the
      colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert,
      who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next
      morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect
      Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were formerly used for
      the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so
      that they might be available on the return of the colonists, for the
      machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and nothing of the
      apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite House in order to
      finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by means of a double
      rope held below, and which, when once hauled down, left no communication
      between the upper landing and the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have a warm day of it,&rdquo; said the reporter, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Dr. Spilett,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;we shall walk under the shade of
      the trees and shan&rsquo;t even see the sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter made
      Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the
      journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb placed himself at the onagers&rsquo; heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and
      the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert offered a
      seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony. The moment
      for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having
      ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side
      of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers,
      leaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods
      which formed the region of the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to
      pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few
      creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the
      colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground.
      Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees, and
      other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could reach.
      The feathered tribes of the island were all represented&mdash;grouse,
      jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos, parrots,
      and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly at their
      approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first excursions they
      had made on their arrival at the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; observed Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;I notice that these creatures,
      both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods have,
      therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly
      find some traces of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or
      less recent, of the passage of a band of men&mdash;here branches broken
      off the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and
      footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a
      settled encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The
      reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who were,
      perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would
      necessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous to
      leave unguarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House,
      their progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way
      through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before
      entering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who
      faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang
      returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to fear,
      either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom,
      whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the evening of
      the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House,
      on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the
      existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently,
      however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the soil owed its
      astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal, for their
      appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that the night
      might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to deal with wild
      beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted fires all around
      his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense; but the convicts
      would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames, and it was,
      therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were to
      watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should be
      relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the
      contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett in
      one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns over
      the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to
      the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun. The
      silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the
      chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate
      Master Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the
      15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than
      difficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than six
      miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their
      hatchets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful
      trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the small
      ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a very
      winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met
      with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out like
      the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of which the
      onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp of excellent
      flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of magnificent
      kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising
      to a height of two hundred feet. These were the tree-kings of New Zealand,
      as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to
      the hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a
      couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary,
      called emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong to
      the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs could
      carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was their
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some
      footprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were
      attentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the
      other, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men&rsquo;s feet
      were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently camped on this
      spot; but,&mdash;and this was the object of so minute an examination,&mdash;a
      sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that case would have
      been that of Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton was not with them!&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;and if he was not with them, it was because the
      wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a den
      to which they may be tracked like tigers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the reporter, &ldquo;it is more probable that they wander at
      random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they
      will be masters of the island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The masters of the island!&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor; &ldquo;the masters of the
      island!...&rdquo; he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was
      seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, &ldquo;Do you know, Captain
      Harding,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the ball that went through Herbert&rsquo;s chest, and I promise you it
      won&rsquo;t miss its mark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from
      the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas!
      conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus
      Harding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from
      Reptile Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and
      the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing
      to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor that,
      no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.

    <h2>
      Chapter 12
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration of all
      that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls River. The
      colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as it was
      comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only
      from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their height and
      their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil,
      more astonishing here than in any other part of the island. One might have
      said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or Africa had been
      transported into this temperate zone. This led them to conclude that the
      superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in its upper layer, but
      warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which could not belong to a
      temperate climate. The most frequently occurring trees were knaries and
      eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the colonists&rsquo; object was not simply to admire the magnificent
      vegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would
      have been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which the
      first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their island no
      longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession of it,
      miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the last
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully
      sought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more deserted
      camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This does not surprise me,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding to his companions. &ldquo;The
      convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam Point,
      and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after crossing
      Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we took on
      leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the wood. But,
      arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they would discover
      no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going northwards again,
      they came upon the corral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where they have perhaps returned,&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;for they would naturally
      suppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is only
      a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of Cyrus&rsquo; opinion,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and I think that it is among
      the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their lair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, captain, straight to the corral!&rdquo; cried Pencroft. &ldquo;We must finish
      them off, and till now we have only lost time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; replied the engineer; &ldquo;you forget that we have a reason
      for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some
      habitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the one
      hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of
      gratitude to perform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was well said, captain,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;but, all the same, it
      is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable that
      the stranger&rsquo;s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was
      organized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the
      night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before
      his illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air, between
      the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His place was no
      longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore,
      where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely
      piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already
      partly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the west
      coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s plan was this:&mdash;To minutely survey the valley forming
      the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the
      corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not,
      to entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations
      which had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were
      impatient to regain entire possession of their island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the
      largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river&rsquo;s bank,
      became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly and
      rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not venture
      without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the flanks,
      springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and emulating each
      other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed that the banks of
      the stream had been recently frequented&mdash;nothing announced either the
      presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening the
      cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of
      trees still hid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it
      was occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts
      were probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert
      had done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait
      until night came on.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the
      approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience,
      volunteered to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;wait till night. I will not allow
      one of you to expose himself in open day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, captain&mdash;&rdquo; answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you, Pencroft,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by
      bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched
      the neighboring parts of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence reigned
      under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a footstep on
      the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would have been
      heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying on the grass,
      his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of uneasiness. At eight
      o&rsquo;clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be
      made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to
      set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding consented. Top and Jup were
      to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for a bark or a cry at a
      wrong moment would give the alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be imprudent,&rdquo; said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, &ldquo;you
      have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it
      is occupied or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity
      rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty
      feet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound, advanced
      with great caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a less
      mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment to
      hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett and
      Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which
      rose the palisade.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of
      trees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared to
      be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from the wood
      to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic
      term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the palisade might
      knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon Spilett and the
      sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that any imprudence on
      their part, of which they would be the first victims, would fall
      afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were killed, what would
      become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he
      supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when
      the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes it will be quite dark,&rdquo; whispered Spilett in the
      sailor&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;then will be the time to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his
      energies, and waited, swearing to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if it
      issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin rose
      like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night spread
      rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the
      wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to be
      absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a little
      darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its
      distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have
      posted one of their number to guard against any surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spilett grasped his companion&rsquo;s hand, and both crept towards the corral,
      their guns ready to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single
      ray of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had
      supposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the
      outer bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the
      convicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had
      fastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the goats,
      sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether they
      had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral. This
      would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail. Now,
      if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of the
      expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance of
      surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately
      attempting to cross the palisades?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not the reporter&rsquo;s opinion. He thought it better to wait until
      all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate
      into the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach the
      palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be
      guarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return to
      the cart, where they would consult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the reporter
      without making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, after a little thought, &ldquo;I now have reason to believe
      that the convicts are not in the corral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon know,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;when we have scaled the palisade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the corral, my friends!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we leave the cart in the wood?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;it is our wagon of ammunition and provisions,
      and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, then!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the
      palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as when
      Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass
      completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready to
      fire. Jup, at Pencroft&rsquo;s orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash, to
      prevent him from bounding forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating, the
      little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the
      dangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers&rsquo; heads to hold
      them. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the
      door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was open!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say now?&rdquo; asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and
      Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can swear,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;that this gate was shut just now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when Pencroft
      and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be doubted, as
      the gate then closed could only have been opened by them. Were they still
      there, or had one of their number just gone out?
    </p>
    <p>
      All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of
      the colonists, but how could they be answered?
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure,
      drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw
      glimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. &ldquo;It is
      our only chance,&rdquo; said he to his companions, &ldquo;of finding the convicts
      collected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power!
      Forward!&rdquo; The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their guns
      ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the charge of
      Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb
      on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark
      and deserted corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window,
      then feebly lighted by the inner light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used by
      Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bed lay the body of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,&mdash;&ldquo;Ayrton!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists
      rushed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long and
      cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great bruises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton!&rdquo; cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had just
      found again under such unexpected circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then
      at the others,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton! Ayrton!&rdquo; repeated Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the house in the corral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will come back!&rdquo; cried Ayrton. &ldquo;Defend yourselves! defend
      yourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he fell back exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spilett,&rdquo; exclaimed the engineer, &ldquo;we may be attacked at any moment.
      Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come
      back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer&rsquo;s orders.
      There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was in the
      hands of the convicts!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and
      reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire.
      Herbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking
      the corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock
      the settlers over one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of
      the forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the
      enclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which
      watered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From the
      side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood out white
      in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the enclosure
      remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart entering the
      circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by the door,
      as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and rush
      to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ready to fire, my friends!&rdquo; cried Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little stream,
      shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they
      see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed on
      Lincoln Island!

    <h2>
      Chapter 13
    </h2>
    <p>
      How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for a
      moment before he was dreading their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer
      possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again become
      unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence
      of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton&rsquo;s house,
      or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts. It was very
      probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the
      circumstances under which the bodies had been found, since he himself was
      not aware that he was in the corral. But at any rate he would be in a
      position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible
      execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions
      cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost
      safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as
      much as he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November, at
      nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the palisade.
      They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern, at the foot
      of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were about
      to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by the name
      which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to murdering
      Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his former
      accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon his aid
      to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate into that
      hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the island, after
      murdering the colonists!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned, would
      rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton&mdash;bound, gagged, and
      closely watched&mdash;lived in this cave for four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after
      their arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on Ayrton&rsquo;s
      stores, but did not live at the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the colonists&rsquo; 
      arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting of having
      killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned alone. His
      companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton&rsquo;s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of
      Herbert&rsquo;s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at
      the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the time that
      the colonists, detained by Herbert&rsquo;s illness, remained in the corral, the
      pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and
      feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and
      night. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear
      possible that he could escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts,
      still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their retreat,
      and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior of the
      island, or the south coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope of
      ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened by
      ill-treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and hearing
      failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two days, he
      could give no information whatever of what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Captain Harding,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;since I was imprisoned in that cavern,
      how is it that I find myself in the corral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the
      enclosure?&rdquo; answered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their
      assistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little
      stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now broad daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken by
      death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five
      convicts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without
      uttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined
      the bodies, already stiffened by the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bore no apparent trace of any wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of
      one, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder of
      that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause of
      which it was impossible to conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is there that they have been struck!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with what weapon?&rdquo; cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the
      secret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who has struck the blow?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The avenging power of the island,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;he who brought you
      here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does
      for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will
      accomplished, conceals himself from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make search for him, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we will search for him,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;but we shall not
      discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases
      to call us to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing,
      both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which it
      proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity evinced in
      such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of
      disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus
      Harding&rsquo;s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us search,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and God grant that we may some day be
      permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal with
      ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by rendering
      him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some signal service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were
      solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to
      discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the name
      of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree superhuman
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their influence
      soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb and Pencroft
      carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some distance from
      the corral, and buried them deep in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during
      his seclusion. He learned Herbert&rsquo;s adventures, and through what various
      trials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired of
      ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts had
      ruthlessly murdered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, &ldquo;a duty remains
      for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the
      convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that we
      are once more masters of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; answered Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;let us search all this labyrinth of the
      spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole
      unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a
      mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our
      benefactor,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;we will do all that it is humanly possible to
      do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we stay at the corral?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall stay here,&rdquo; answered Harding. &ldquo;Provisions are abundant, and we
      are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides, if
      necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;Only I have a remark to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have a
      voyage to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A voyage?&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to Tabor Island,&rdquo; answered Pencroft. &ldquo;It is necessary to carry a
      notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton
      is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows if
      it is not already too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pencroft,&rdquo; asked Ayrton, &ldquo;how do you intend to make this voyage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the &lsquo;Bonadventure.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Bonadventure!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Ayrton. &ldquo;She no longer exists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; exists no longer!&rdquo; shouted Pencroft, bounding from his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Ayrton. &ldquo;The convicts discovered her in her little harbor
      only eight days ago, they put to sea in her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And?&rdquo; said Pencroft, his heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the
      vessel went to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; said Herbert, taking the sailor&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;we will build another
      &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;&mdash;a larger one. We have all the ironwork&mdash;all the
      rigging of the brig at our disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know,&rdquo; returned Pencroft, &ldquo;that it will take at least five or
      six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can take our time,&rdquo; said the reporter, &ldquo;and we must give up the voyage
      to Tabor Island for this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my &lsquo;Bonadventure!&rsquo; my poor &lsquo;Bonadventure!&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Pencroft, almost
      broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; was certainly a thing to be lamented by the
      colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired as soon as
      possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with bringing their
      researches to bear on the most secret parts of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and
      lasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and their
      numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevations. It
      was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow gorges, perhaps even
      in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the proper place to pursue
      their researches. No part of the island could have been more suitable to
      conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown. But so
      irregular was the formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged
      to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the
      volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There Ayrton
      showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and in which
      he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This cavern was
      just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable quantity of
      ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts in order to
      form a reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and other
      trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the
      southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the
      picturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer.
      Stones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the
      rocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be seen
      that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount Franklin,
      three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral,
      which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on
      the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became rivers by
      the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of
      the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part. As to the
      Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the
      cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of this nature, spreading in
      a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the Serpentine Peninsula was
      watered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a
      retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary
      for life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had
      they discovered the presence of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the
      piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of lava,
      that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of two
      valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation, strewn
      with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great blocks of
      mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration. It contained
      a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly concealed and
      difficult of access.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic period,
      still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into the depths
      of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries, waving lighted
      torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they sounded the
      shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did not appear that the
      foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient passages, or that his
      arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano
      had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and
      the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that
      absolute silence did not reign there.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several
      hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear a
      deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the
      rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant mutterings,
      which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires. Several times
      both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process was taking place
      in the bowels of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the volcano is not totally extinct?&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,&rdquo; replied Cyrus
      Harding, &ldquo;some change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered
      extinct, may evidently again burst forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,&rdquo; asked Spilett, &ldquo;would
      there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; answered the reporter. &ldquo;The crater, that is to say,
      the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would
      escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts of
      the island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, my dear Spilett,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;should it not follow
      the road naturally traced out for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, volcanoes are capricious,&rdquo; returned the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notice,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;that the inclination of Mount Franklin
      favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just
      now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change
      the mountain&rsquo;s center of gravity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,&rdquo; observed Gideon
      Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; replied the engineer, &ldquo;especially when the subterranean forces
      begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long
      rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us,
      and it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest
      desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At any rate,
      even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would be
      seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground is
      considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course towards
      the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring parts of Shark
      Gulf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate an
      approaching eruption,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Harding, &ldquo;not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it was
      only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it is probable
      that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have accumulated rocks,
      cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which I spoke, may at any
      time become overcharged. But at the first serious effort, every obstacle
      will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the
      island, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will
      burst under the pressure of gas. Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be
      better that there should not be an eruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet we are not mistaken,&rdquo; remarked the reporter. &ldquo;Mutterings can be
      distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the engineer, again listening attentively. &ldquo;There
      can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can
      neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to
      whom they made known the state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, &ldquo;The volcano wants to play his pranks! Let
      him try, if he likes! He will find his master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him,
      if he so much as pretends to open it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As may be seen, the sailor&rsquo;s confidence in the tutelary deity of his
      island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until
      now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it
      knew how to escape the colonists&rsquo; most minute researches, for, in spite of
      all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,&mdash;the obstinacy,&mdash;with
      which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of the mysterious
      being could not be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was
      extended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret
      nooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every
      rock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It was
      explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the
      first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at the
      bottom of which opened the crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths the
      rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or vapor, no
      heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption. But neither there,
      nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces
      of him of whom they were in search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully
      examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest,
      although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf.
      No one!&mdash;nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly
      expended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger
      mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be
      prolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing
      that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island, and
      the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb,
      particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed their
      imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by
      means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the
      door, they re-established communication between their habitation and the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third
      anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.

    <h2>
      Chapter 14
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from
      Richmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of their
      country, always present in their thoughts!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it
      appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed.
      But what had been the incidents of this terrible war? How much blood had
      it not cost? How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?
      They often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee the
      day when they would be permitted once more to see their country. To return
      thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link with the
      inhabited world, to establish a communication between their native land
      and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of
      their existence in this colony, founded by them, and which would then be
      dependent on their country, was this a dream impossible to realize?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only two ways of accomplishing it&mdash;either a ship must
      appear off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel
      strong enough to sail to the nearest land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;our good genius, himself provides us with the
      means of returning to our country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons was
      waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not even
      have made a gesture of surprise. In their state of mind nothing appeared
      improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to
      fact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel&mdash;a
      really urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as soon as
      possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton&rsquo;s new residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the &ldquo;Bonadventure&rdquo; no longer existed, six months at least would be
      required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was approaching,
      and the voyage would not be made before the following spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have time to get everything ready for the fine season,&rdquo; remarked the
      engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. &ldquo;I think,
      therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel it will be
      best to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch yacht at
      Tabor Island is very uncertain. It may even be that, having arrived
      several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly searched for
      some trace of Ayrton. Will it not then be best to build a ship which, if
      necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian Archipelago or to New
      Zealand? What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, captain,&rdquo; answered the sailor; &ldquo;I think that you are as capable
      of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor the tools
      are wanting. It is only a question of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to
      300 tons?&rdquo; asked Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven or eight months at least,&rdquo; replied Pencroft. &ldquo;But it must not be
      forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is
      difficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our
      vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;that will be exactly the most favorable
      time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island or
      to a more distant land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it will, captain,&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;Make out your plans then; the
      workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good helping
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer&rsquo;s plan, and it
      was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the construction
      of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great labor, but the
      colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by their previous
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and
      making the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in
      felling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks. The
      forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms. They took
      advantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a
      practicable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were
      carried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to the
      road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat
      capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part
      of the Serpentine Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for
      they could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to
      allow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously
      during the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial
      gales of some violence. Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by
      climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his stout
      shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the Chimneys,
      and there awaited the time for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the northern
      zone. At the same time other work was actively continued, and soon all
      trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of Prospect Heights. The
      mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the poultry-yard. It had
      appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions, for the feathered
      population had increased considerably. The stable now contained five
      onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed themselves to be
      either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony now possessed a
      plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular Yorkshire or Kentucky
      oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their arms never tired. Then
      who could have enjoyed better health than these workers, and what good
      humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as they formed a thousand
      plans for the future!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect, and
      there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral.
      Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work
      than in the pleasures of his companions. But he was a valuable workman at
      need&mdash;strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He was esteemed and
      loved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of the
      settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look after the
      flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of milk required by
      Neb. These excursions at the same time afforded opportunities for hunting.
      Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with Top in front, traversed more
      often than their companions the road to the corral, and with the capital
      guns which they carried, capybaras, agouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for
      large game, ducks, grouse, jacamars, and snipe for small game, were never
      wanting in the house. The produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed,
      several turtles which were taken, excellent salmon which came up the
      Mercy, vegetables from the plateau, wild fruit from the forest, were
      riches upon riches, and Neb, the head cook, could scarcely by himself
      store them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course
      been repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers was
      at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there. Besides,
      the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at any rate from
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of pirates,
      or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was possible that
      companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the secret of his
      plans, and might be tempted to imitate him. The colonists, therefore, were
      careful to observe the sea around the island, and every day their
      telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington Bays. When
      they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west with no less
      attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a large
      section of the western horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to
      be on their guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had
      conceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to
      heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which, if
      necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy. Granite House might,
      by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the corral with
      its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained, would always be
      the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land on the island,
      and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought
      also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage. This was a
      project which might be left for consideration, and they were, besides,
      obliged to put off its execution until the next spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard,
      and soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities,
      rose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet in
      length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship beam.
      But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the frosts
      and bad weather. During the following week they fixed the first of the
      stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The wind
      blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The engineer
      was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed&mdash;which besides,
      he could not have established in any other place near to Granite House&mdash;for
      the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from the fury of the open
      sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the very foot of the
      granite cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted to
      the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely covered
      by Flotsam Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued
      their labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind
      tearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow
      from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather. But when a
      severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring the
      hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the 10th
      of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was
      the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was
      comparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at
      almost the same distance from the equator. In the northern hemisphere, or
      at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of the
      United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation of
      the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no
      intumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds; here,
      in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has even been observed,&rdquo; remarked Harding one day to his companions,
      &ldquo;that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by
      the cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the
      winters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of
      Scotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the heat
      which it received during the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a better
      situation for benefiting by this restitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, Captain Harding,&rdquo; asked Herbert, &ldquo;why does Lincoln Island
      appear to escape the common law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is difficult to explain,&rdquo; answered the engineer. &ldquo;However, I should
      be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the situation
      of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know, my boy, is
      colder than the Northern Hemisphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in the
      south than in the north of the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; remarked Pencroft, &ldquo;and when I have been serving on board
      whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;may
      then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs
      comparatively near to Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,&rdquo; answered Cyrus
      Harding, &ldquo;and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that we owe our
      rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an entirely physical
      cause, which renders the Southern colder than the Northern Hemisphere. In
      fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer, it is
      necessarily more distant during the winter. This explains then the excess
      of temperature in the two seasons, for, if we find the winters very cold
      in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that the summers here, on the
      contrary, are very hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, if you please, captain,&rdquo; asked Pencroft, knitting his brows,
      &ldquo;why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn&rsquo;t
      just, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Pencroft,&rdquo; answered the engineer, laughing, &ldquo;whether just or not,
      we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this peculiarity. The
      earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but an ellipse, as it
      must by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth occupies one of the
      foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its course is at its apogee,
      that is, at its farthest from the sun, and at another point it is at its
      perigee, or nearest to the sun. Now it happens that it is during the
      winter of the southern countries that it is at its most distant point from
      the sun, and consequently, in a situation for those regions to feel the
      greatest cold. Nothing can be done to prevent that, and men, Pencroft,
      however learned they may be, can never change anything of the
      cosmographical order established by God Himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; added Pencroft, &ldquo;the world is very learned. What a big book,
      captain, might be made with all that is known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!&rdquo; answered
      Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold
      with its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to
      Granite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more
      particularly to Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he to Neb one day, &ldquo;I would give you by notarial deed
      all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good enough
      fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper for me!
      Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is the knowing
      every morning what has happened the day before in other places than this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neb began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my word,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the only thing I think about is my daily
      work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity,
      achieved by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the
      brig had been a new source of riches. Without speaking of the complete rig
      which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and tools of
      all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments, were now piled
      in the storerooms of Granite House. It had not even been necessary to
      resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials. Though the
      colonists had suffered from cold during their first winter, the bad season
      might now come without their having any reason to dread its severity.
      Linen was plentiful also, and besides, they kept it with extreme care.
      From chloride of sodium, which is nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus
      Harding easily extracted the soda and chlorine. The soda, which it was
      easy to change into carbonate of soda, and the chlorine, of which he made
      chloride of lime, were employed for various domestic purposes, and
      especially in bleaching linen. Besides, they did not wash more than four
      times a year, as was done by families in the olden times, and it may be
      added, that Pencroft and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the postman to
      bring him his newspaper, distinguished themselves as washermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe, and
      the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight
      degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than the
      preceding winter. But then, what splendid fires blazed continually on the
      hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with long,
      zebra-like streaks! Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a few steps
      from them. Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the construction of
      the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which required more trouble
      to transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must be
      confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary to
      make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a servant he was, clever,
      zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and he might have
      been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped brothers in the Old
      and New Worlds!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;when one has four hands at one&rsquo;s service,
      of course one&rsquo;s work ought to be done so much the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the intelligent creature did it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made
      round the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought back
      fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His power was
      not manifested in any way. It is true that it would have been superfluous,
      for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any painful trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between
      the unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established
      through the granite, and if Top&rsquo;s instinct had as it were felt it, there
      was no further sign of it during this period. The dog&rsquo;s growling had
      entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two friends&mdash;for
      they were such&mdash;no longer prowled round the opening of the inner
      well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from the first
      the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure that this was all that was
      to be said about this enigma, and that he should never arrive at a
      solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur which
      would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who could tell what the
      future might have in reserve?

    <p>
      At last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which
      might be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw
      smoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising in
      the air.

    <h2>
      Chapter 15
    </h2>
    <p>
      The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in
      silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer
      heaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires
      provoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be
      foreseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption, it
      was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from it.
      The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island had
      already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava hardened
      on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape of the
      crater&mdash;the opening broken in the upper edge&mdash;the matter would
      be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at the
      summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open. This had
      occurred in the two hemispheres&mdash;at Etna, Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand
      on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared. In fact, an
      earthquake&mdash;a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic eruption&mdash;is
      enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain, and to open new
      outlets for the burning lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without
      exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons.
      After all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that
      Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an
      earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater
      open in the southern side of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain,
      and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness,
      without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The phenomenon was still
      concentrated in the lower part of the central crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the
      vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall on
      the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill, which
      rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The mechanism
      of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of
      Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of wood, a second
      vertical movement to move the saw&mdash;this was all that was wanted; and
      the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders, and pulleys
      properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September the skeleton
      of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay in the dockyard.
      The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the timbers having been
      sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the vessel could already be
      seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very slender in the after-part,
      would evidently be suitable for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the
      planking would still take a considerable time. Very fortunately, the iron
      work of the pirate brig had been saved after the explosion. From the
      planks and injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a
      large quantity of copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths,
      but the carpenters had much to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking,
      and the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work
      finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night
      came the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any time
      they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
      and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then ascended to
      Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting subject
      the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then spoke of the
      future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage in the schooner
      to inhabited lands would make in their situation. But always, in the midst
      of these plans, prevailed the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln
      Island. Never would they abandon this colony, founded with so much labor
      and with such success, and to which a communication with America would
      afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to end their
      days there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;you will never abandon Lincoln Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was made up long ago, my boy,&rdquo; answered Pencroft. &ldquo;I shall expect
      you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly
      chaps of your youngsters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s agreed,&rdquo; replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Captain Harding,&rdquo; resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, &ldquo;you will
      be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it
      support? Ten thousand at least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the
      reporter actually started a newspaper&mdash;the New Lincoln Herald!
    </p>
    <p>
      So is man&rsquo;s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which
      will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living
      creatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and
      this it is which justifies it, over all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little dream
      of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan
      again and show himself to all restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged later
      than usual. It was nine o&rsquo;clock. Already, long badly concealed yawns gave
      warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding towards his bed,
      when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room, suddenly rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton, Pencroft,
      Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely
      believing their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; cried Neb. &ldquo;Was it the devil who rang it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather is stormy,&rdquo; observed Herbert. &ldquo;Might not its influence of
      electricity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes
      were turned, shook his head negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett. &ldquo;If it is a signal, whoever it may be
      who has made it, he will renew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who do you think it is?&rdquo; cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; answered Pencroft, &ldquo;but he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailor&rsquo;s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this
      reply to the tenants of Granite House:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the corral immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; exclaimed Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists&rsquo; fatigue
      had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about to urge
      them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without having
      uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House, and were
      standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They could do
      without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as the
      sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering and
      heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes,
      reflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the
      island itself. The night was very threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from finding
      the familiar road to the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed the
      bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was no
      doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for answer
      to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply concerned in
      their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful in his action! Must
      not this stranger have indeed mingled with their existence, have known the
      smallest details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have
      been able always to act in the very nick of time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the
      arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could
      not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds, influenced
      by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless and silent. Not a
      breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the colonists alone
      resounded on the hardened ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by
      this remark from Pencroft:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to have brought a torch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by this reply from the engineer:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall find one at the corral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past
      nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the
      five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined
      the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently the
      storm would not be long in bursting forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder
      growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached
      the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from thence
      that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which
      was perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the
      lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we been deceived by an illusion?&rdquo; murmured Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the corral immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire.
      Everything was in order&mdash;the pile on the box containing it, as well
      as all the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who came here the last time?&rdquo; asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, captain,&rdquo; answered Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a note!&rdquo; cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this paper were written these words in English:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow the new wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been
      sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating
      directly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to the
      old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm then
      burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each
      lightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit of
      the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional flashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between
      the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the
      first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the
      isolator to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating
      substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission of
      the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern spurs
      of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow it!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be
      heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get forward as
      fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the
      corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its narrowest
      part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees,
      sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The engineer had
      supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and
      that the stranger&rsquo;s retreat would be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur,
      and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild
      basalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and felt
      for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the wire was
      running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the depths of
      those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the
      summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there
      as if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the
      colonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west. The
      wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side
      of a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning a
      fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea. The
      descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the danger; they
      were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew
      them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in broad
      daylight would have been considered impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through
      the gleams of light. Harding was first&mdash;Ayrton last. On they went,
      step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they struggled to
      their feet and scrambled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had reached
      the bottom of the basalt cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the
      sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a hundred
      paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the
      waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions were stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must they
      then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine cavern? In
      their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The tide is high. At low water the way will be
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can make you think-&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us to
      reach him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no
      objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite
      possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by
      the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching in
      a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was
      re-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists&rsquo; emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary
      ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman
      apparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of the
      mysterious genius of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to
      reconnoiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation
      could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle,
      entered the yawning gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour the opening will be practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is there, then?&rdquo; said Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you doubt it?&rdquo; returned Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,&rdquo; observed
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either the cavern will be completely dry,&rdquo; replied Harding, &ldquo;and in that
      case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some means of
      transport will be put at our disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea.
      There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was like the
      arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the water. He
      drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior projection of
      the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump in!&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the oars,
      Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern, lighted
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly rose;
      but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too slight,
      for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to be
      ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a sound
      could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts
      dating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the sea;
      others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal&rsquo;s Cave, in the
      island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of Morgat, in
      the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica,
      those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth caverns in
      Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in length! In
      many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns, and preserved
      them for the admiration of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center
      of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing,
      making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in short sentences,
      when all at once,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More to the right!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The
      engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wire was there fastened to the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half-a-mile
      must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding&rsquo;s voice
      was again heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light illuminating
      the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the island, of which
      nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt
      shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns
      erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of
      the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured from
      forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the tumult
      outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed out by
      the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the
      boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could not
      be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing
      nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the
      projections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source,
      and its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave, and
      it filled it entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water,
      causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards
      the light, which was now not more than half a cable&rsquo;s length distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350 feet,
      and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic wall,
      blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here considerably,
      the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side walls, the end
      cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with the electric
      fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if the light issued
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the
      surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued from
      it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat. This
      apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250 feet long,
      and rose about ten or twelve above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He
      gazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the
      reporter&rsquo;s arm,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he! It can only be he!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;he!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett
      alone could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect upon
      him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! an outlawed man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; said Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the engineer&rsquo;s command the boat approached this singular floating
      apparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of
      light through a thick glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was
      there. All darted down the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the end
      of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined
      to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense saloon&mdash;a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with
      all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry&mdash;appeared
      before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought themselves suddenly
      transported into a land of enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice
      their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his
      companions, he uttered these words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0058" id="link2HCH0058">

    <h2>
      Chapter 16
    </h2>
    <p>
      At these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell upon
      his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance
      commanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just
      risen. He appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had
      been gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful,
      as he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I have no name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I know you!&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he
      were about to annihilate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, what matters now?&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;I am dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his hand&mdash;it
      was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb stood
      respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose atmosphere
      was saturated with the electric fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and
      the reporter to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that being
      whom they had styled the &ldquo;genius of the island,&rdquo; the powerful protector
      whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so efficacious, the
      benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude! Their eyes beheld a
      man only, and a man at the point of death, where Pencroft and Neb had
      expected to find an almost supernatural being!
    </p>
    <p>
      But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why
      had the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name
      which he had believed known to none?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his arm,
      he regarded the engineer, seated near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the name I formerly bore, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and also that of this wonderful submarine
      vessel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the captain, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Nautilus.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you&mdash;do you know who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with
      the inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of the
      sea, the only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have betrayed
      my secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who,
      consequently, cannot be accused of treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years
      since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the
      midst of which the &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; was struggling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of &lsquo;Twenty Thousand
      Leagues Under the Sea,&rsquo; which contains your history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The history of a few months only of my life!&rdquo; interrupted the captain
      impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;but a few months of that strange
      life have sufficed to make you known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a great criminal, doubtless!&rdquo; said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile
      curling his lips. &ldquo;Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;at
      any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the world,
      ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of
      existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their causes; but
      what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us
      since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our lives to a good,
      generous, and powerful being, and that this being so powerful, good and
      generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; answered the captain simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and
      the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express
      itself in their gestures and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more
      emotion than he doubtless intended to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you have heard all,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole
      remaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending against
      extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to repose for
      a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow may never come,
      and when the reporter offered his assistance,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my hours are numbered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the then
      independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten years
      of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education in all
      respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and knowledge he
      might one day take a leading part in raising his long degraded and heathen
      country to a level with the nations of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by
      Nature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of every
      kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were extensive
      and profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to
      be everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him no
      attractions. Though young and possessed of every personal advantage, he
      was ever grave&mdash;somber even&mdash;devoured by an unquenchable thirst
      for knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that
      he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings. He
      became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a philosopher to
      whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a statesman versed in the
      policy of European courts. To the eyes of those who observed him
      superficially he might have passed for one of those cosmopolitans, curious
      of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those opulent travelers,
      haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place to place, and are of
      no country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title
      of &ldquo;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.&rdquo; Here, therefore, will apply
      the observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard to
      the discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note
      already published on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing the
      hope instilled into him from his earliest days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble
      Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than that by
      which he was inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they tenderly
      loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking to carry
      out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At length, as
      he vainly fancied, it presented itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more
      unscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they
      might successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought them
      out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had
      established peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and
      gross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the belief
      that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the object of his
      long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He forthwith devoted
      his talents and wealth to the service of this cause. He aided it in
      person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life equally with the
      humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was ten times wounded
      in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it not, but at length the
      sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the atrocious mutiny was
      brought to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger,
      and if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from
      without, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would
      have been a thing of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought
      openly and without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he
      managed to escape from his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.
      The sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again
      under the rule of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the
      mountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome by
      disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey to
      profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the civilized
      world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some score of his
      most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving no trace
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth?
      Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the
      Pacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was
      constructed from his designs. By methods which will at some future day be
      revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of
      electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed for
      all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving, lighting, and
      heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its myriads of fish,
      its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not only all that nature
      supplied, but also all that man had lost in its depths, sufficed for every
      want of the prince and his crew&mdash;and thus was his most ardent desire
      accomplished, never again to hold communication with the earth. He named
      his submarine vessel the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; called himself simply Captain Nemo,
      and disappeared beneath the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to
      pole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered
      incalculable treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by
      the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible riches
      which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations who fought
      for the independence of their country.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in
   fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)
</pre>
    <p>
      For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow-creatures,
      when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were cast
      on board his vessel. They were a French professor, his servant, and a
      Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled overboard by a
      collision which had taken place between the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; and the United
      States frigate &ldquo;Abraham Lincoln,&rdquo; which had chased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; taken now
      for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel
      carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance
      had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of
      doing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were
      enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues
      under the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of the
      past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the
      &ldquo;Nautilus&rsquo;s&rdquo; boats. But as at this time the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; was drawn into the
      vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain naturally
      believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found
      their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware that the Frenchman
      and his two companions had been miraculously cast on shore, that the
      fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered them assistance, and that
      the professor, on his return to France, had published that work in which
      seven months of the strange and eventful navigation of the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; were
      narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time after this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus,
      traversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found their
      last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the Pacific.
      At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all those who had
      taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in navigating
      the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes
      served him as a harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this moment
      furnished an asylum to the &ldquo;Nautilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no
      longer, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his
      former companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon
      which carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in his diving dress
      he was walking beneath the water at a few cables&rsquo; length from the shore of
      the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea. Moved by a
      feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways; but
      his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of the
      basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could no longer
      pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was sufficient depth
      of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar, there was not enough for
      the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; whose draught of water was considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men
      thrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be
      himself discovered by them. By degrees he became interested in their
      efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by the
      ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the
      secrets of their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily
      reach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the
      projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they
      recounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from
      them the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the
      abolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo
      with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought back
      the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the lake, who
      caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many things useful
      to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the stream of the
      Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at the time of the
      attack by the baboons, who made known the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor
      Island, by means of the document enclosed in the bottle, who caused the
      explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at the bottom of
      the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the sulphate
      of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the convicts with the
      electric balls, of which he possessed the secret, and which he employed in
      the chase of submarine creatures. Thus were explained so many apparently
      supernatural occurrences, and which all proved the generosity and power of
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges still
      further. There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and, his
      heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are
      aware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; by means of
      a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not have done
      this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently acquainted with
      his history to address him by the name of Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then spoke;
      he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent an
      influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and himself
      thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed
      by one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now that you know my history, your judgment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident
      witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which the
      French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and terrible
      sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the professor and his two
      companions, the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; being chased by a frigate in the north of the
      Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and sunk her
      without mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding understood the captain&rsquo;s allusion, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an enemy&rsquo;s frigate,&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for an
      instant into the Prince Dakkar, &ldquo;an enemy&rsquo;s frigate! It was she who
      attacked me&mdash;I was in a narrow and shallow bay&mdash;the frigate
      barred my way&mdash;and I sank her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of my life, gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied
      gravely, &ldquo;Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be
      resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress. It is one of
      those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can judge.
      He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be right
      may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that we may
      admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of history,
      which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I wrong, or in the right?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding replied, &ldquo;All great actions return to God, from whom they
      are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn
      your loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may
      God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>

      Chapter 17
    </h2>
    <p>
      Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the
      cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the
      artificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the
      &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone around the
      floating vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back upon
      the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite House,
      for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of
      the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; which millions could not have purchased, and to wait there
      for that death which was swiftly approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost
      unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed the
      condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was
      gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the fragile
      tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in the heart
      and head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to render
      any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for
      some days? He himself had said that no remedy could avail, and he awaited
      with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do nothing,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of what is he dying?&rdquo; asked Pencroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is simply fading out,&rdquo; replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;if we move him into the open air, and
      the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered the engineer, &ldquo;it is useless to attempt it.
      Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He has
      lived for a dozen years on board the &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo; and on board the
      &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; he desires to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s reply, for he raised
      himself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall die here&mdash;it is my wish; and
      therefore I have a request to make of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now
      arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted by
      the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling.
      He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from the splendid
      tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d&rsquo;oeuvres of the Italian, Flemish,
      French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and bronze on their
      pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the after-partition; the
      aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful productions of the sea&mdash;marine
      plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of inestimable value; and, finally,
      his eyes rested on this device, inscribed over the pediment of the museum&mdash;the
      motto of the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mobilis in mobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces
      of art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn
      of so many years in the abysses of the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding respected the captain&rsquo;s silence, and waited till he should
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his whole
      life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise, then,&rdquo; continued Captain Nemo, &ldquo;to carry out my last wishes, and
      I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We promise,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; resumed the captain, &ldquo;to-morrow I shall be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain
      arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the &lsquo;Nautilus.&rsquo; It
      is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their
      resting-place shall be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were received with profound silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay attention to my wishes,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; is imprisoned
      in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but, although egress
      is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the abyss, and there bury
      my remains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;yourself
      and companions will leave the &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo; for all the treasures it
      contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain with you of
      Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted. That coffer
      yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions, most of them
      mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought happiness
      possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and
      myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a future day, you
      may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades,
      Captain Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on high I
      shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but that they
      will prosper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments&rsquo; repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness, Captain
      Nemo continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which
      you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the
      &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo; and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the
      vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done, captain,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but,
      before leaving the &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo; go to the stern and there open two large
      stop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will
      penetrate into the reservoirs, and the &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; will gradually sink
      beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation
      to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they had nothing to
      do but to conform to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have your promise, gentlemen?&rdquo; added Captain Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, captain,&rdquo; replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave
      him for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the event
      of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, &ldquo;I shall live
      until to-morrow, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and
      arrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was
      established, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical
      power of the &ldquo;Nautilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; was a masterpiece containing masterpieces within itself, and
      the engineer was struck with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above
      the water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which
      protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind this
      eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and in
      which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; over
      the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light up to
      a considerable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they were
      vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their hearts
      were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often aided
      them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at the point
      of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of
      this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince Dakkar
      would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man!&rdquo; said Pencroft. &ldquo;Is it possible that he can have lived at the
      bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found peace
      there any more than elsewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed Ayrton, &ldquo;might have enabled us to leave Lincoln
      Island and reach some inhabited country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;I for one would never risk myself in
      such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, Pencroft,&rdquo; answered the reporter, &ldquo;that the navigation of a
      submarine vessel such as the &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; ought to be very easy, and that we
      should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no
      lee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the
      ocean are as calm as those of a lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; replied the sailor, &ldquo;but I prefer a gale of wind on board a
      well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not beneath
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said the engineer, &ldquo;it is useless, at any rate as regards
      the &lsquo;Nautilus,&rsquo; to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The
      &lsquo;Nautilus&rsquo; is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it.
      Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of the
      fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose
      entrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain
      Nemo&rsquo;s wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law, and
      we will fulfil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his companions
      again descended to the interior of the &ldquo;Nautilus.&rdquo; There they took some
      refreshment and returned to the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome
      him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile even curled
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists drew around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you are brave and honest men. You have
      devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed your conduct.
      I have esteemed you&mdash;I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr. Harding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this
      Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to leave
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To return, captain!&rdquo; answered Pencroft quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To return, Pencroft?&rdquo; said the captain, with a smile. &ldquo;I know, it is
      true, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now
      is, and it seems to you a paradise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our project, captain,&rdquo; interposed Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;is to annex it to the
      United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately
      situated in this part of the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the captain;
      &ldquo;your toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One&rsquo;s native
      land!&mdash;there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I
      loved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some last wish to transmit,&rdquo; said the engineer with emotion,
      &ldquo;some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains of
      India?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race,
      and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.&mdash;But
      to return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and
      beyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live alone!
      You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln Island,
      and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those wretches
      have destroyed the vessel you have built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We propose to construct a vessel,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;sufficiently
      large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner
      or later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too
      many recollections ever to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here that we have known Captain Nemo,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here only that we can make our home!&rdquo; added Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if&mdash;&rdquo; replied the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said
      simply,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s companions, respecting the wish, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and soon
      recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private
      matters which the dying man had confided to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident
      that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the
      power of reaction against his physical weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo;
       for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish it
      from day in the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble
      features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible
      words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents
      of his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his
      extremities were already cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and
      smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort
      succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that
      attitude to compose himself for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one o&rsquo;clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light
      gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, &ldquo;God
      and my country!&rdquo; he quietly expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the
      Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton&rsquo;s eyes. Neb was
      on his knees by the reporter&rsquo;s side, motionless as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead, said
      solemnly, &ldquo;May his soul be with God!&rdquo; Turning to his friends, he added,
      &ldquo;Let us pray for him whom we have lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain
      by carrying out his dying wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; taking with them
      the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which contained
      wealth amounting to millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed.
      The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner
      as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the
      &ldquo;Nautilus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the side
      of the submarine vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line,
      were two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in
      the submersion of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo;
       slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves.
      The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while
      the cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of
      electric light faded away, and soon after the &ldquo;Nautilus,&rdquo; now the tomb of
      Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed.

      Chapter 18
    </h2>
    <p>
      At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the
      cavern, to which they gave the name of &ldquo;Dakkar Grotto,&rdquo; in memory of
      Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty
      under the arcade, washed on the right by the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As additional
      precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little beach which
      bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it could run no
      risk of harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the
      thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet
      obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of the
      southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the wind
      had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, which
      rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken the
      road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to preserve
      the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and
      the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the
      night of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The
      unknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the man
      whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo,
      was no more. His &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; and he were buried in the depths of the abyss.
      To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before.
      They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power
      which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus Harding, could
      not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a profound silence during
      their journey to the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be actively
      pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his time and
      labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future lay before
      them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great of having at
      their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the sea even in
      heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of need, a voyage of
      some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be completed, the
      colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to
      gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the
      shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to
      Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to Ayrton. This was a
      precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility of the Scotch yacht
      reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest importance that
      nothing should be neglected on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton, assisted
      by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably called off by
      other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It was important
      that the new vessel should be ready in five months&mdash;that is to say,
      by the beginning of March&mdash;if they wished to visit Tabor Island
      before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable. Therefore
      the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary to
      manufacture rigging, that of the &ldquo;Speedy&rdquo; having been saved entire, so
      that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors, to
      the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months and a
      half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It was
      already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and
      that the vessel would behave well at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble
      when one or the other abandoned the carpenter&rsquo;s axe for the gun of the
      hunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite
      House, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy
      Pencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were
      not at the dockyard. When this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by
      way of venting his feelings, did the work of six men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season.
      For some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated
      with electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that
      the distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but
      incessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the
      globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence,
      and the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were
      struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of those
      gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the southern
      extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going
      on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection between the
      commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth? Cyrus
      Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for the development
      of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak to
      the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers, perceived
      an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in
      watching the summit of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;those are not vapors this time! It seems to me
      that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the changes
      going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months had the
      crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet produced
      only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But now the vapors
      were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a grayish column,
      more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and which spread like
      an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above
      the summit of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire is in the chimney,&rdquo; observed Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t put it out!&rdquo; replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The volcano ought to be swept,&rdquo; observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, Neb!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll
      undertake the job, no doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount
      Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant
      muttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone
      somewhat apart, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an
      important change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer
      in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly
      menaced by an approaching eruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain,&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;we shall witness the eruption; and if it
      is a good one, we&rsquo;ll applaud it. I don&rsquo;t see that we need concern
      ourselves further about the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;for the ancient track of the lava
      is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto overflowed
      towards the north. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be
      better it should not take place,&rdquo; said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; answered the sailor. &ldquo;Perhaps there may be some valuable
      substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may
      turn to good account!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good
      from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not
      regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava, in
      consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace the
      wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might
      present themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by
      earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of
      substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on
      the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not
      be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk of
      disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic matter
      might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the terrestrial
      structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear to
      the ground, &ldquo;it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound, like
      that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced
      that Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a subterranean
      roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly away, as if some
      violent storm had passed through the profundities of the globe. But no
      explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might therefore be
      concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage through the
      central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently large, no
      convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;are we not going back to work? Let Mount
      Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as it
      pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb,
      Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at our
      work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair of hands
      would not be too many. Before two months I want our new &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo;&mdash;for
      we shall keep the old name, shall we not?&mdash;to float on the waters of
      Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft,
      descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick
      mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the
      timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all took
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of
      January, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not,
      besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice, large
      shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through an
      extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed between
      its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried all these
      vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett remarked these
      somber appearances, and from time to time discussed the evident progress
      of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption. It
      was, besides, of the first importance from every point of view, that the
      vessel should be finished with the least possible delay. In presence of
      the eventualities which might arise, the safety of the colonists would be
      to a great extent secured by their ship. Who could tell that it might not
      prove some day their only refuge?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert
      again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and
      the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent
      matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke
      accumulated at the mouth of the crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crater is on fire!&rdquo; said Herbert, who, more active than his
      companion, first reached the plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic
      torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much smoke,
      and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that their light
      gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind of lurid
      brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out confusedly the
      wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor obscured the
      sky, through which glimmered a few stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The change is rapid!&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not surprising,&rdquo; answered the reporter. &ldquo;The reawakening of the
      volcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that the
      first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the mountain
      to discover Captain Nemo&rsquo;s retreat. It was, if I mistake not, about the
      15th of October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Herbert, &ldquo;two months and a half ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,&rdquo;
       resumed Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;and it is not to be wondered at that they now
      break out with such violence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gideon Spilett, &ldquo;but there is a great difference between
      that and an earthquake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,&rdquo; answered Cyrus
      Harding, &ldquo;may God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to
      the effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is simply
      the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the pressure
      of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. It is this effect which is being
      produced at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What magnificent flames!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater,
      the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands of
      luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various
      directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated it,
      leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied by successive
      explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of machine-guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned to
      Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much so,
      indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate
      danger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and no,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; continued the reporter, &ldquo;would not the greatest misfortune
      which could happen to us be an earthquake which would overturn the island?
      Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared, since the vapors and lava
      have found a free outlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;and I do not fear an earthquake in the
      sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil
      provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may
      produce great disasters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, my dear Cyrus?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few
      days I shall learn more on this point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of the
      volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the echoes
      of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days passed by&mdash;the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The
      construction of the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering
      further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his
      energy. Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister
      aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of
      which fell back into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would
      only look at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and it
      did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure, had
      yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on the
      northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the
      northern slope of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other
      duties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the
      island. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where the
      flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the provision of
      forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should
      proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as he was sufficient
      for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and the rest were
      somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Captain Harding,&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, &ldquo;our working days will not
      be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall return to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;but it is necessary
      that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is
      progressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eruption! always the eruption!&rdquo; answered Pencroft, with an air of
      discontent. &ldquo;An important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself
      very little about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might be the sailor&rsquo;s opinion, the expedition projected by the
      engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus
      Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn
      by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount
      Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled
      heavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances.
      It was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange opacity
      and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered pumice-stone, and
      grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were held in suspension in
      the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so fine that they have
      been observed in the air for whole months. After the eruption of 1783 in
      Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was thus charged with
      volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were only with difficulty
      discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the
      present occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the corral
      when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly changed
      the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a
      covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately, the wind blew
      from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud dissolved itself
      over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very singular, Captain Harding,&rdquo; said Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very serious,&rdquo; replied the engineer. &ldquo;This powdered pumice-stone,
      all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward in
      the lower depths of the volcano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can nothing be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you,
      therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral.
      In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red Creek and
      examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern aspect. Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Harding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any
      rate I will come back for you in two hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the
      engineer&rsquo;s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which seemed
      to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of an
      eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed Red
      Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had discovered
      a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he counted
      thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by some
      piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected in this
      part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was saturated
      with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors. Cyrus Harding
      felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn, and which was but
      pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble beneath
      him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the northern
      part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the
      crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of lava burst
      from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic matter had
      not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would prefer that it were so,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding to himself. &ldquo;At
      any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed
      track. Who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger does
      not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the danger does
      not lie there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation
      enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on this
      side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his mind that
      the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the
      subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder,
      interrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached the
      corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The animals are cared for, Captain Harding,&rdquo; said Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, Ayrton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem uneasy, Captain Harding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a lamp, Ayrton,&rdquo; answered the engineer; &ldquo;we will start at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral. The
      gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding Ayrton, took
      the narrow path which led westward to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen
      from the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had
      fled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the two
      colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each other.
      They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs,
      for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments, to
      make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the oxygen
      had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration. At every
      hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was therefore
      past ten o&rsquo;clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of
      the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the
      northwest coast of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity,
      following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that
      stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was
      less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished
      surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon
      reached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped
      towards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no
      beach could be seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat
      upon the basaltic rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar
      Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The iron boat should be there,&rdquo; said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here, Captain Harding,&rdquo; replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the
      fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board, Ayrton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the waves
      carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there Ayrton, with
      the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took the oars, and
      the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so that its rays fell
      before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered through the shades of
      the grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Nautilus&rdquo; was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its
      electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray
      escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal
      of Captain Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled the
      engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A deathlike
      silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the anterior
      portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling which
      proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes from the volcano,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon
      betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were
      almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what Captain Nemo feared,&rdquo; murmured Cyrus Harding, changing
      countenance. &ldquo;We must go to the end, notwithstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat
      towards the head of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat
      reached the extreme end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the walls
      of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano.
      What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a hundred
      feet&mdash;it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were too
      perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great
      thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height
      horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed
      the basaltic wall at a greater elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent
      vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken by
      large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of the
      water&rsquo;s edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible
      danger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the
      oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of
      Dakkar Grotto.

      Chapter 19
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed at the
      corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton arrived at
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed them
      of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from which no
      human power could deliver them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion,
      &ldquo;our island is not among those which will endure while this earth endures.
      It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of which it
      bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not
      clearly comprehend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself, Cyrus!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; replied Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;or rather I will simply afford you
      the explanation which, during our few minutes of private conversation, was
      given me by Captain Nemo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Nemo!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his
      death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last service!&rdquo; exclaimed Pencroft, &ldquo;the last service! You will see
      that though he is dead he will render us others yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did the captain say?&rdquo; inquired the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, my friends,&rdquo; said the engineer. &ldquo;Lincoln Island does not
      resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which Captain
      Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the subversion
      of its foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; cried Pencroft, who, in spite of
      the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Pencroft,&rdquo; resumed the engineer, &ldquo;I will tell you what Captain
      Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during
      the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is only
      separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it. Now,
      this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the
      sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure
      from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that
      after a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters of
      the lake which fill the cavern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. &ldquo;The sea will
      extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;should a day arrive when the sea, rushing
      through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the
      interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day
      be blown into the air&mdash;just as would happen to the island of Sicily
      were the Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.
      They now understood the danger by which they were menaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger to
      be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be possible
      to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on the shores of
      a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of the water. But
      they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk of blowing up a
      portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is suddenly expanded by
      intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity whose temperature might be
      estimated at thousands of degrees, would be converted into steam with a
      sudden energy which no enclosure could resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful and
      approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall of Dakkar
      Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a question of months, nor of
      weeks, but of days; it might be of hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow.
      They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves personally,
      but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered them, which they
      had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped to render so
      flourishing. So much effort ineffectually expended, so much labor lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor
      did he attempt to conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of the
      colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was not an
      hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel should be
      pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the sole chance
      of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail to
      sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House? The
      contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than sufficient
      to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its duration. But
      it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive them before the
      inevitable catastrophe should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of
      January the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no change had
      taken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with
      flames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater. But during
      the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the level of
      the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which formed over
      the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The colonists at
      first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out of Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurred about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand
      feet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had been
      thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation.
      Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the
      plain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea. The
      aperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a
      glare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere
      appeared red-hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the
      new summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase
      too full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the
      volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The corral! the corral!&rdquo; exclaimed Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the new
      crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the
      island, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with
      instant destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ayrton&rsquo;s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers&rsquo; stables. The cart was
      at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought&mdash;to hasten
      to the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the
      terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them.
      Already a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from the
      side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the palisade.
      The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered with
      terror, fled in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into
      vapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up the
      house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to mark
      the spot where the corral once stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To contend against this disaster would have been folly&mdash;nay, madness.
      In presence of Nature&rsquo;s grand convulsions man is powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now daylight&mdash;the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his
      companions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the
      probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take. The soil
      sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be
      feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach
      the plateau of Prospect Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lake will cover us,&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; was Cyrus Harding&rsquo;s only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior
      cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their progress.
      It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and on the other
      that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its passage. There
      was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava; on the contrary, the
      colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The volcano, without its
      crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it was by a sort of flat
      table which replaced the ancient crater. From two openings in its southern
      and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth, thus forming two
      distinct streams. Above the new crater a cloud of smoke and ashes, mingled
      with those of the atmosphere, massed over the island. Loud peals of
      thunder broke, and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of
      the mountain, whose mouth vomited forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to
      more than a thousand feet, burst in the air like shells. Flashes of
      lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano&rsquo;s eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the
      colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood.
      Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava,
      overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the
      corral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly
      transformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while
      others, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but
      slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination of
      the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves
      became solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and more
      menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fire, and enormous wreaths
      of smoke rolled over the trees, whose trunks were already consumed by the
      lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of
      Red Creek. A question of life or death was now to be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and
      aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever it
      might be, then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of the
      island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will
      overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will remain
      on the surface of the soil. We shall have no prospect but that of
      starvation upon these barren rocks&mdash;a death which will probably be
      anticipated by the explosion of the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his foot,
      &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of working any longer on the vessel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pencroft,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;we must do our duty to the last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through
      the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the
      lake. At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it been
      greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To work!&rdquo; cried Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer&rsquo;s thought was at once understood. It might be possible to
      dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels, picks,
      axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen trees they
      succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet high and some
      hundreds of paces in length. It seemed to them, when they had finished, as
      if they had scarcely been working more than a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after reached
      the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a river about
      to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which
      could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West. But the dam held
      firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent precipitated
      itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded
      this strife of the two elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen could
      describe the marvelous horror of this scene&mdash;what pencil could depict
      it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling lava.
      The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if the valves
      of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, however considerable
      might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must eventually be
      absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream of lava, fed
      from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new waves of
      incandescent matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified and
      accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface fell
      other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step nearer the
      center of the lake. In this manner was formed a pier which threatened to
      gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the water displaced
      by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water rent the air with a
      deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind, fell in rain upon the
      sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the blocks of lava piled
      themselves one on another. Where formerly stretched the calm waters of the
      lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking rocks, as if an upheaving of
      the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine the waters of the lake aroused
      by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified by an intense frost, and some
      conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake three hours after the
      eruption of this irresistible torrent of lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time water would be vanquished by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the
      effusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They had
      before them some days&rsquo; respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights, Granite
      House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these few days
      it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking the vessel,
      and launching her. The colonists would then take refuge on board the
      vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the waters. With
      the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the island there
      could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House, once so sure a
      retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the
      colonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as
      twenty men could have done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment&rsquo;s
      repose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled
      them to work night and day. The flow of lava continued, but perhaps less
      abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely choked
      up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread over the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not so
      with the western part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of Falls
      River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the creek being
      flat, met with no obstacle. The burning liquid had then spread through the
      forest of the Far West. At this period of the year, when the trees were
      dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire instantaneously, in
      such a manner that the conflagration extended itself both by the trunks of
      the trees and by their higher branches, whose interlacement favored its
      progress. It even appeared that the current of flame spread more rapidly
      among the summits of the trees than the current of lava at their bases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras,
      koalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks of
      the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon. But
      the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any attention
      to even the most formidable of these animals. They had abandoned Granite
      House, and would not even take shelter at the Chimneys, but encamped under
      a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of Prospect
      Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never Pencroft, who could
      not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now so utterly
      devastated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the
      island was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised
      their heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there were
      a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the
      devastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption of
      lava had been complete. Where formerly sprang up that charming verdure,
      the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa. In the
      valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now flowed towards
      the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up, the colonists would
      have no means of quenching their thirst. But, fortunately the lava had
      spared the southern corner of the lake, containing all that remained of
      the drinking water of the island. Towards the northwest stood out the
      rugged and well-defined outlines of the sides of the volcano, like a
      gigantic claw hovering over the island. What a sad and fearful sight, and
      how painful to the colonists, who, from a fertile domain covered with
      forests, irrigated by watercourses, and enriched by the produce of their
      toils, found themselves, as it were, transported to a desolate rock, upon
      which, but for their reserves of provisions, they could not even gather
      the means of subsistence!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough to break one&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo; said Gideon Spilett, one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Spilett,&rdquo; answered the engineer. &ldquo;May God grant us the time to
      complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat
      lessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less
      abundantly, if I mistake not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding. &ldquo;The fire is still burning in
      the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment. We
      are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a
      conflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or
      later the flames must reach the powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to
      work, and let us not lose an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February, the lava
      continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the previous
      limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied matter should
      overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could not escape.
      Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of the island
      vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the
      vessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then?
      The intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel as
      soon as the hull should be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the
      interior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the
      essential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge away
      from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the vessel to
      Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of
      eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the wall of
      granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event of any
      convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore concentrated
      upon the completion of the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching the
      vessel in ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth year
      of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even Pencroft
      lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by the devastation
      and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it is true, were concentrated upon his
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall finish it,&rdquo; he said to the engineer, &ldquo;we shall finish it,
      captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox will
      soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island to spend
      the winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah, how
      unfortunate! Who could have believed it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get on,&rdquo; was the engineer&rsquo;s invariable reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they worked away without losing a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; asked Neb, a few days later, &ldquo;do you think all this could have
      happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Neb,&rdquo; answered Cyrus Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, for one, don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; whispered Pencroft to Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I!&rdquo; answered Neb seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first week of March appearances again became menacing.
      Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain upon
      the island. The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the
      back of the volcano. The torrent flowed along the surface of the hardened
      tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had withstood
      the first eruption. The stream, flowing this time towards the southwest
      shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and invaded the
      plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of the colonists
      was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables,
      were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all directions. Top and
      Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their instinct warned them
      of an impending catastrophe. A large number of the animals of the island
      had perished in the first eruption. Those which survived found no refuge
      but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the plateau of Prospect Heights
      afforded asylum. But even this last retreat was now closed to them, and
      the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of the granite wall, began to pour
      down upon the beach its cataracts of fire. The sublime horror of this
      spectacle passed all description. During the night it could only be
      compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors above
      and its boiling masses below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the
      upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch her
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for the
      launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the 9th of
      March.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping from
      the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than three
      thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way under the
      pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central shaft into the
      igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor. But the crater could not
      afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor. An explosion, which might have
      been heard at a distance of a hundred miles, shook the air. Fragments of
      mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a few minutes, the ocean rolled
      over the spot where Lincoln island once stood.

    <h2>
      Chapter 20
    </h2>
    <p>
      An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten
      from the water&rsquo;s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of
      the Pacific had not engulfed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had
      fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the
      rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point.
      All around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount
      Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf, the
      plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port
      Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so
      distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could now
      be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge
      to the six colonists and their dog Top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well as
      those representing the fauna of the island&mdash;all either crushed or
      drowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in
      some crevice of the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton had
      survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been hurled
      into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island rained down
      on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a cable&rsquo;s
      length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which they
      found footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions
      taken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a little
      fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the rock, was
      all that the unfortunate colonists possessed. Their last hope, the vessel,
      had been shattered to pieces. They had no means of quitting the reef; no
      fire, nor any means of obtaining it. It seemed that they must inevitably
      perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two days,
      although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life.
      All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in their
      present position. They were in the hand of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a prey
      to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not for a
      moment quit the engineer&rsquo;s side, as if demanding from him that assistance
      he had no power to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!&rdquo; often repeated Pencroft. &ldquo;If
      we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have nothing,
      nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Nemo did right to die,&rdquo; said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate companions
      husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating only what
      would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their weakness was extreme.
      Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the
      shadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a vessel
      should appear in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well from
      experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific. Could they
      calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the Scotch yacht
      would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton at Tabor Island?
      It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing she should come there,
      as the colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing out
      Ayrton&rsquo;s change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having
      explored Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and return to
      lower latitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death, death
      from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer
      conscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort,
      from time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the
      desert ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton&rsquo;s arms were extended toward
      a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees, then
      upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an object.
      The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line, under all
      steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out some hours
      before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;!&rdquo; murmured Ayrton&mdash;and fell back without sign of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to
      the attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of a
      steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word from Ayrton explained everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to Heaven,
      he said, &ldquo;Oh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, the &ldquo;Duncan,&rdquo; Lord Glenarvan&rsquo;s yacht, now commanded by
      Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to
      find Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land after twelve years of
      expiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their native
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Grant,&rdquo; asked Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;who can have suggested to you the
      idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of
      coming a hundred miles farther northeast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Harding,&rdquo; replied Robert Grant, &ldquo;it was in order to find, not
      only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My companions and myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, at Lincoln Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Lincoln Island!&rdquo; exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb,
      and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?&rdquo; inquired
      Cyrus Harding, &ldquo;it is not even named in the charts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,&rdquo; answered
      Robert Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A document!&rdquo; cried Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, and here it is,&rdquo; answered Robert Grant, producing a paper
      which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, &ldquo;the present
      residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Captain Nemo!&rdquo; cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice,
      and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper found
      at the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Pencroft, &ldquo;it was then he who took our &lsquo;Bonadventure&rsquo; and
      hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to leave this notice,&rdquo; added Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was then right in saying,&rdquo; exclaimed the sailor, &ldquo;that even after his
      death the captain would render us a last service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion,
      &ldquo;may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our
      benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding,
      and murmured the name of Captain Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, &ldquo;Where should this
      coffer be deposited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at the
      very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now
      faithfully handed to the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ayrton! Ayrton!&rdquo; said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing
      Robert Grant, &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you left behind you a criminal; you find
      in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I am
      proud to clasp in mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain
      Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken of
      what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the charts
      of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their
      country once more at peace after the terrible conflict in which right and
      justice had triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the
      colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the
      purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the
      finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the
      name of the castaways restored to their country by the &ldquo;Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say,
      to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the
      hospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a vast colony to which
      they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the Pacific.
      A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name of Mount
      Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests became the
      forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on terra firma.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions,
      everything prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island
      was absent, for they had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his
      master; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was
      more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed his
      studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon Spilett,
      who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from
      Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister of
      Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who had
      taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had been
      in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which they had
      arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four years had
      supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a fragment of
      granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne
      the name of Captain Nemo.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
